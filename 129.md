# ``LiquidateCurrencyAction#liquidateCollateralCurrency()  will revert or lead the contract to loss funds when ``localBuffer / liquidationDiscount) <= collateralHaircut``.

## Summary
``LiquidateCurrencyAction#liquidateCollateralCurrency()  will revert or lead the contract to loss funds when ``localBuffer / liquidationDiscount) <= collateralHaircut``.

## Vulnerability Detail

Consider the flow ``LiquidateCurrencyAction#liquidateCollateralCurrency() -> _collateralCurrencyLiquidation -> LiquidateCurrency.liquidateCollateralCurrency() -> _calculateCollateralToRaise()``.  Pay attention to the implementation of  ``_calculateCollateralToRaise()``:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/liquidation/LiquidateCurrency.sol#L206-L258](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/liquidation/LiquidateCurrency.sol#L206-L258)

When ``localBuffer / liquidationDiscount) == collateralHaircut``, L251 will have a divide-by-zero error, the function and thus, the whole flow, as well as ``LiquidateCurrencyAction#liquidateCollateralCurrency()`` will revert in this case. 

When ``localBuffer / liquidationDiscount) < collateralHaircut``, the denominator will be negative, as a result, both ``requiredCollateralPrimeCash`` and ``localPrimeCashFromLiquidator`` will be negative, in contrast to the expectation that they should be both positive.  As a result,  instead of paying prime cash from the liquidator, the contract will pay the liquidator with prime cash. So the function will not work properly in this case. Loss of funds for the contract. 

## Impact
``LiquidateCurrencyAction#liquidateCollateralCurrency()  will revert or lead the contract to loss funds when ``localBuffer / liquidationDiscount) <= collateralHaircut``.

## Recommendation
Add a require statement to make sure ``localBuffer / liquidationDiscount) > collateralHaircut``.
