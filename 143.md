# insufficient oracle validation

## Summary
there is no check how recent the data provided by the oracle is 
## Vulnerability Detail
There is no freshness check on the timestamp of the prices, so old prices may be used which could lead to a loss or unfair profit 
## Impact
Old prices mean traders will get wrong values for their positions
