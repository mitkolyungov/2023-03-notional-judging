# Accounts can't be liquidated

## Summary

Accounts can't be liquidated because the function `GenericToken.transferNativeTokenOut` reverts

## Vulnerability Detail

When the function `GenericToken.transferNativeTokenOut` is called with the param `withdrawWrapped` being false, the transfer transaction on line 25 will revert if the `account` parameter is a contract that reverts on receive.

This can happen when the function `LiquidateCurrencyAction.liquidateCollateralCurrency` is called to liquidate an account that is a contract that reverts on receive. `LiquidateCurrencyAction.liquidateCollateralCurrency` takes the `liquidateAccount` as parameter and is then passing the `liquidateAccount` to `BalanceHandler.finalizeCollateralLiquidation` on line 246:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/external/actions/LiquidateCurrencyAction.sol#L246

Then `BalanceHandler._finalize` is called with the `account` param which is the account that should be liquidated, and false is passed as hardcoded value for the `withdrawWrapped` parameter:

Then `TokenHandler.withdrawPrimeCash` is called with the `account` param which is still the account that should be liquidated and with the `withdrawWrapped` parameter which is false:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/balances/BalanceHandler.sol#L154

Finally `GenericToken.transferNativeTokenOut` is called with the `account` param which is still the account that should be liquidated and with `withdrawWrappedNativeToken` which is false: 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/balances/TokenHandler.sol#L241

Inside `GenericToken.transferNativeTokenOut` the `withdrawWrapped` param was passed in with the value false, so the if statement on line 21 is false and we reach the else statement where the transfer transaction is done on line 25 which reverts if the `account` is a contract that reverts on receive:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/balances/protocols/GenericToken.sol#L25


A user can set up a malicious contract that reverts on receive and thus can not be liquidated, because `GenericToken.transferNativeTokenOut` reverts.


## Impact

No liquidations can be performed on accounts that are contracts that revert on receive.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

You could consider using `call()` instead of `transfer()` when sending ETH. Then upon failure send WETH instead of ETH.

```solidity
(bool success, /* bytes memory response*/) = payable(account).call{value: amount}('');
if (success == false) {
    // Send WETH
}
```
