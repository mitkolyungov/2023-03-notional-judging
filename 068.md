# struct PrimeCashFactorsStorage reserves only 128 bits, not 128 bytes, and will cause future storage collision/confusion.

## Summary
struct ``PrimeCashFactorsStorage`` reserves only 128 bits, not 128 bytes, and will cause future storage collision/confusion.

## Vulnerability Detail

struct ``PrimeCashFactorsStorage`` is supposed to reserve 128 bytes for the following: 
```javascrsipt
uint128 _reserved;
    // Reserving the next 128 bytes for future use in case we decide to implement debt
    // caps on a currency. In that case, we will need to track the total fcash overall
    // and subtract the total debt held in vaults.
    // uint32 maxUnderlyingDebt;
    // uint32 totalfCashDebtOverall;
    // uint32 totalfCashDebtInVaults;
    // uint32 totalPrimeDebtInVaults;
    // 8 bytes left
    
    // Storage slot 3 [Prime Scalars, 240 bytes]
    // Scalars are stored in 18 decimal precision (i.e. double rate precision) and uint80
    // maxes out at approx 1,210,000e18
    // ln(1,210,000) = rate * years = 14
    // Approx 46 years at 30% interest
    // Approx 233 years at 6% interest
```

Instead, it only reserves 128 bits, not 128 bytes. 

As a result, it will cause future storage collision/confusion in the future and leads to unpredictable behavior of the protocol, including losing funds. 


## Impact
