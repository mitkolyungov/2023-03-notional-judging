# getfCashGivenCashAmount() uses fCash_1 - fCash_0 == 0 as the convergence criteria, failing to consider rounding error.

## Summary
``getfCashGivenCashAmount()`` uses ``fCash_1 - fCash_0 == 0`` as the convergence criteria, failing to consider rounding error.  In practice, usually convergence only require a sufficiently small difference between ``fCash_1`` and ``fCash_0``.  


## Vulnerability Detail
``getfCashGivenCashAmount()``  allows a user to to use the secant method to converge on an ``fCash`` amount given the amount of cash.

The function  uses ``fCash_1 - fCash_0 == 0`` as the convergence criteria, however, due to rounding error, ``fCash_1`` and ``fCash_0`` might not be exactly equal to each other, and might off by 1 for example. In practice, usually convergence only require a sufficiently small difference between ``fCash_1`` and ``fCash_0``.  The following piece of code shows the possible rounding errors:

```javascript
            int256 fCash_n = fCash_1.sub(diff_1.mul(fCashDelta).div(diff_1.sub(diff_0)));
```

As a result, it is possible that fCash_1 - fCash_0 will be off by 1 but the function will revert instead of reporting a convergence. 


## Impact
``getfCashGivenCashAmount()`` uses ``fCash_1 - fCash_0 == 0`` as the convergence criteria, failing to consider rounding error.  As a result, 
 it is possible that when ``fCash_1`` is off by 1 from ``fCash_0`` but the function will revert instead of reporting a convergence.

## Recommendation
Introducing a ``delta`` for the difference of ``fCash_1`` and ``fCash_0``. As along as they are close to each other by ``delta``, we consider it is a convergence.
