# cToken mint/redeem return value is never handled

## Summary
cToken mint/redeem return value is never handled
## Vulnerability Detail
the cToken mint/redeem return value is never handled
```solidity

  for (uint256 j; j < depositData.targets.length; ++j) {
                // This will revert if the individual call reverts.
                GenericToken.executeLowLevelCall(
                    depositData.targets[j], 
                    depositData.msgValue[j], 
                    depositData.callData[j]
                );
            }
```
in the snippet above we see that there is no where in the logic where the return value is ever checked.

the return value from compound should be an ERROR_CODE which should be handled by notional. Instead of checking the return value, we instead see just a low level call. Since there is no check for the return value, there is no way to know if they call was indeed successful.
## Impact
notional does not handle the return value from compound. we instead see just a low level call. The return value is important to validate if the call was indeed successful. Without the check there is no way to know, and this could lead to various problems down the line for the protocol.

## Recommendation
We recommend to add logic to the function which handles the return values
