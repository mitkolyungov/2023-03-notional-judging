# Debt cannot be repaid without redeeming vault share

## Summary

Debt cannot be repaid without redeeming the vault share. As such, users have to redeem a certain amount of vault shares/strategy tokens at the current market price to work around this issue, which deprives users of potential gains from their vault shares if they maintain ownership until the end.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/external/actions/VaultAccountAction.sol#L277

```solidity
File: VaultAccountAction.sol
224:     function exitVault(
225:         address account,
226:         address vault,
227:         address receiver,
228:         uint256 vaultSharesToRedeem,
229:         uint256 lendAmount,
230:         uint32 minLendRate,
231:         bytes calldata exitVaultData
232:     ) external payable override nonReentrant returns (uint256 underlyingToReceiver) {
..SNIP..
261:         // If insufficient strategy tokens are redeemed (or if it is set to zero), then
262:         // redeem with debt repayment will recover the repayment from the account's wallet
263:         // directly.
264:         underlyingToReceiver = underlyingToReceiver.add(vaultConfig.redeemWithDebtRepayment(
265:             vaultAccount, receiver, vaultSharesToRedeem, exitVaultData
266:         ));
```

There is a valid scenario where users want to repay debt without redeeming their vault shares/strategy tokens (mentioned in the comments above "or if it is set to zero" at Line 251-263). In this case, the users will call `exitVault` with `vaultSharesToRedeem` parameter set to zero. The entire debt to be repaid will then be recovered directly from the account's wallet.

Following is the function trace of the `VaultAccountAction.exitVault`:

```bash
VaultAccountAction.exitVault
└─VaultConfiguration.redeemWithDebtRepayment
  └─VaultConfiguration._redeem
    └─IStrategyVault.redeemFromNotional
      └─MetaStable2TokenAuraVault._redeemFromNotional
        └─MetaStable2TokenAuraHelper.redeem
          └─Balancer2TokenPoolUtils._redeem
            └─StrategyUtils._redeemStrategyTokens
```

https://github.com/notional-finance/leveraged-vaults/blob/c707f7781e36d7a1259214dde2221f892a81a9c1/contracts/vaults/common/internal/strategy/StrategyUtils.sol#L153

```solidity
File: StrategyUtils.sol
147:     function _redeemStrategyTokens(
148:         StrategyContext memory strategyContext,
149:         uint256 strategyTokens
150:     ) internal returns (uint256 poolClaim) {
151:         poolClaim = _convertStrategyTokensToPoolClaim(strategyContext, strategyTokens);
152: 
153:         if (poolClaim == 0) {
154:             revert Errors.ZeroPoolClaim();
155:         }
```

The problem is that if the vault shares/strategy tokens to be redeemed are zero, the `poolClaim` will be zero and cause a revert within the `StrategyUtils._redeemStrategyTokens` function call. Thus, users who want to repay debt without redeeming their vault shares/strategy tokens will be unable to do so.

## Impact

Users cannot repay debt without redeeming their vault shares/strategy tokens. To do so, they have to redeem a certain amount of vault shares/strategy tokens at the current market price to work around this issue so that `poolClaim > 0`, which deprives users of potential gains from their vault shares if they maintain ownership until the end.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Within the `VaultConfiguration.redeemWithDebtRepayment` function, skip the vault share redemption if `vaultShares` is zero. In this case, the `amountTransferred` will be zero, and the subsequent code will attempt to recover the entire `underlyingExternalToRepay` amount directly from account's wallet.

```diff
function redeemWithDebtRepayment(
	VaultConfig memory vaultConfig,
	VaultAccount memory vaultAccount,
	address receiver,
	uint256 vaultShares,
	bytes calldata data
) internal returns (uint256 underlyingToReceiver) {
	uint256 amountTransferred;
	uint256 underlyingExternalToRepay;
	{
..SNIP..
+		if (vaultShares > 0) {
			// Repayment checks operate entirely on the underlyingExternalToRepay, the amount of
			// prime cash raised is irrelevant here since tempCashBalance is cleared to zero as
			// long as sufficient underlying has been returned to the protocol.
			(amountTransferred, underlyingToReceiver, /* primeCashRaised */) = _redeem(
				vaultConfig,
				underlyingToken,
				vaultAccount.account,
				receiver,
				vaultShares,
				vaultAccount.maturity,
				underlyingExternalToRepay,
				data
			); 
+		}
..Recover any unpaid debt amount from the account directly..
..SNIP..
```

Alternatively, update the `StrategyUtils._redeemStrategyTokens` function to handle zero vault share appropriately. However, note that the revert at Line 154 is added as part of mitigation to the "minting zero-share" bug in the past audit. Therefore, any changes to this part of the code must ensure that the "minting zero-share" bug is not being re-introduced. Removing the code at 153-155 might result in the user's vault share being "burned" but no assets in return under certain conditions.

```solidity
File: StrategyUtils.sol
147:     function _redeemStrategyTokens(
148:         StrategyContext memory strategyContext,
149:         uint256 strategyTokens
150:     ) internal returns (uint256 poolClaim) {
151:         poolClaim = _convertStrategyTokensToPoolClaim(strategyContext, strategyTokens);
152: 
153:         if (poolClaim == 0) {
154:             revert Errors.ZeroPoolClaim();
155:         }
```
