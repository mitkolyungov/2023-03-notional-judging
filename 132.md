# WRAPPED_FCASH_BEACON address error

## Summary
WRAPPED_FCASH_BEACON address error
## Vulnerability Detail
The `WRAPPED_FCASH_BEACON` address in the Deployments contract is misconfigured, and it is configured as the address of WETH, but WETH cannot implement the `upgradeTo` function in the IUpgradeableBeacon interface.

```solidity
IUpgradeableBeacon internal constant WRAPPED_FCASH_BEACON = IUpgradeableBeacon(0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2);
```

Other addresses also have undeployed issues

PS:This contract (contracts-v2/contracts/global/Deployments.sol) belongs to the scope of audit, I think there is a problem
