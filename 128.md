# Incorrect Initial Value of hasInitialized

## Summary
Incorrect Initial Value of hasInitialized

## Vulnerability Detail
In the constructor, `hasInitialized` is set to `true`, and the comment states that "This will lock everyone from calling initialize on the implementation contract". However, this also locks `DEPLOYER` from calling `initialize()`, and in `initialize()` it's already checked that `msg.sender` must be the `DEPLOYER` address. It's possible that the developer overlooked this when making changes.
```solidity
constructor(
      DeployedContracts memory contracts
  ) {
      GOVERNANCE = contracts.governance;
      VIEWS = contracts.views;
      INITIALIZE_MARKET = contracts.initializeMarket;
      NTOKEN_ACTIONS = contracts.nTokenActions;
      BATCH_ACTION = contracts.batchAction;
      ACCOUNT_ACTION = contracts.accountAction;
      ERC1155 = contracts.erc1155;
      LIQUIDATE_CURRENCY = contracts.liquidateCurrency;
      LIQUIDATE_FCASH = contracts.liquidatefCash;
      TREASURY = contracts.treasury;
      CALCULATION_VIEWS = contracts.calculationViews;
      VAULT_ACCOUNT_ACTION = contracts.vaultAccountAction;
      VAULT_ACTION = contracts.vaultAction;
      VAULT_LIQUIDATION_ACTION = contracts.vaultLiquidationAction;
      VAULT_ACCOUNT_HEALTH = contracts.vaultAccountHealth;

      DEPLOYER = msg.sender;
      // This will lock everyone from calling initialize on the implementation contract
      hasInitialized = true;//@audit  false
  }

  function initialize(address owner_, address pauseRouter_, address pauseGuardian_) public {
      // Check that only the deployer can initialize
      require(msg.sender == DEPLOYER && !hasInitialized);

      owner = owner_;
      // The pause guardian may downgrade the router to the pauseRouter
      pauseRouter = pauseRouter_;
      pauseGuardian = pauseGuardian_;

      hasInitialized = true;
  }
