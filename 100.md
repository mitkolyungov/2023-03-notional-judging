# depositMarginForVault does not check if supply cap has been reached

## Summary
`depositMarginForVault` does not check if supply cap has been reached
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
  function depositMarginForVault(
        VaultConfig memory vaultConfig,
        VaultAccount memory vaultAccount,
        uint256 depositAmountExternal
    ) internal {
        (/* */, int256 primeCashMinted) = TokenHandler.depositUnderlyingExternal(
            vaultAccount.account,
            vaultConfig.borrowCurrencyId,
            depositAmountExternal.toInt(),
            vaultConfig.primeRate,
            false // excess ETH is returned natively, no excess ETH in this method
        );
        vaultAccount.tempCashBalance = vaultAccount.tempCashBalance.add(primeCashMinted);

        // TokenHandler will emit a mint event and then the account will transfer that to the vault
        Emitter.emitTransferPrimeCash(
            vaultAccount.account, vaultConfig.vault, vaultConfig.borrowCurrencyId, primeCashMinted
        );
    }
```
from the snippet above we can see that currently there is no check to see if the amount of prime cash minted has reached the cap. 
```solidity
  /// @notice Checks whether or not a currency has exceeded its total prime supply cap. Used to
    /// prevent some listed currencies to be used as collateral above a threshold where liquidations
    /// can be safely done on chain.
    /// @dev Called during deposits in AccountAction and BatchAction. Supply caps are not checked
    /// during settlement, liquidation and withdraws.
    function checkSupplyCap(PrimeRate memory pr, uint16 currencyId) internal view {
        (uint256 maxUnderlyingSupply, uint256 totalUnderlyingSupply) = getSupplyCap(pr, currencyId);
        if (maxUnderlyingSupply == 0) return;

        require(totalUnderlyingSupply <= maxUnderlyingSupply, "Over Supply Cap");
    }
```
as we can see from the comments in the snippets above, the supply cap is put in place to ensure that currencies are not used as collateral above a certain threshold.

because there is no checks to ensure the cap has been reached. Prime cash can continue to be minted well past the cap.
## Impact
The supply cap was put in place in order to ensure that currencies are not used as collaterall above a certain threshold. since there is no cap, this may lead to currencies being used as collaterall beyond the threshold of the protocol, this could lead to bad debt and a loss of funds for the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We recommend the protocol add logic to ensure the supply cap is never passed
