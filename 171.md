# Vulnerability in NotionalV2FlashLiquidator Contract

## Summary
At [LINE](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/external/liquidators/NotionalV2FlashLiquidator.sol#L72)

This bug bounty report is about a vulnerability found in the code of the `NotionalV2FlashLiquidator` smart contract. The vulnerability allows an attacker to perform unauthorized actions or manipulate the contract's behavior to their advantage.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability resides in the `flashLoan` function of the `NotionalV2FlashLiquidator` contract. The line `return IERC20(assets[0]).balanceOf(address(this));` should be changed to return IERC20(assets[0]).balanceOf(_msgSender());. This change ensures that the correct balance of the flash loan asset is returned to the rightful owner.

## Impact
If the vulnerability is not addressed, an attacker could exploit it to retrieve the remaining balance of the flash loan asset, which should be returned to the owner of the flash loan. By manipulating the code, an attacker could wrongfully claim the balance, leading to financial losses for the legitimate owner.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function flashLoan(
    address flashLender,
    address receiverAddress,
    address[] calldata assets,
    uint256[] calldata amounts,
    uint256[] calldata modes,
    address onBehalfOf,
    bytes calldata params,
    uint16 referralCode
) external onlyOwner returns (uint256) {
    IFlashLender(flashLender).flashLoan(
        receiverAddress,
        assets,
        amounts,
        modes,
        onBehalfOf,
        params,
        referralCode
    );
    return IERC20(assets[0]).balanceOf(address(this)); // <-- Vulnerable line
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to modify the vulnerable line of code as follows:
```solidity
return IERC20(assets[0]).balanceOf(_msgSender());
```
This change ensures that the remaining balance of the flash loan asset is returned to the owner who initiated the flash loan, rather than the contract itself. It is crucial to verify and validate ownership before returning the balance to prevent unauthorized access and potential financial losses.

It is advised to implement this recommendation and thoroughly test the updated code to ensure its correctness and security. Additionally, conducting further security audits and code reviews on the contract can help identify and address any other potential vulnerabilities.

By addressing this vulnerability, the overall security and trustworthiness of the `NotionalV2FlashLiquidator` contract will be significantly improved, providing a more secure environment for flash loan operations.

has same issue with different perspective

The reason for this change is that _msgSender() returns the address of the caller of the current function, whereas address(this) refers to the contract itself. By using _msgSender(), you ensure that the balance of the caller is checked instead of the contract's balance. This change is important if you want to accurately calculate and return the balance of the caller.
