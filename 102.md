# Unnecessary Unchecked Block in Loop Incrementation

## Summary
Unnecessarily unchecked block.

## Vulnerability Detail
The loop counter `i` is incremented within an unchecked block, which is not necessary. Because the loop counter i is a simple increment operation that doesn't require any overflow or underflow protection. Solidity version 0.8.0 and later has built-in overflow and underflow protection, which means any arithmetic operations will automatically revert if they cause an overflow or underflow.

## Impact
It could lead to slightly higher gas fees.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Removing the unchecked block and incrementing `i` directly within the for loop statement is cleaner and more efficient

Example
```solidity
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < holdings.length; i++) {
            address holding = holdings[i];
            uint256 targetAmount = (totalValue * rebalancingTargets[i]) / uint256(Constants.PERCENTAGE_DECIMALS);
            uint256 currentAmount = values[i];

            redeemHoldings[i] = holding;
            depositHoldings[i] = holding;

            if (targetAmount < currentAmount) {
                redeemAmounts[i] = currentAmount - targetAmount;
            } else if (currentAmount < targetAmount) {
                depositAmounts[i] = targetAmount - currentAmount;
            }
        }
```
