# DIVISION BEFORE MULTIPLICATION INCURS PRECISION LOSS

## Summary
The `mint` function of `BaseERC4626Proxy.sol` contract calculates the amount of shares to mint with the `previewMint` function.
The `previewMint` function does the calculation with the `convertToAssets` function and in `convertToAssets` function, the calculation is done this way;

```solidity

function convertToAssets(uint256 shares) public view override returns (uint256 assets) {
        return exchangeRate().mul(shares).div(EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION); //@audit div was earlier done in exchangeRate()
    }
```
Note that `exchangeRate()` was called before multiplying by shares. The point is that in the `exchangeRate()` there was a division before the returned value was multiplied by `shares` in the function above. When it involves multiplication and division, all multiplications should be implemented first before all the divison implemented at the end in order not to lose precision.
See the `exchangeRate()` function where the division was first done before a mulitiplicaiton in `convertToAssets` function

```solidity

    function exchangeRate() public view returns (uint256 rate) {
        uint256 totalValueExternal = _getTotalValueExternal();
        uint256 supply = _totalSupply();
        // Exchange Rate from token to Underlying in EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION is:
        // 1 token = totalValueExternal * EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION / totalSupply
        rate = totalValueExternal.mul(EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION).div(supply);
    }
```

## Vulnerability Detail
The `mint` function of `BaseERC4626Proxy.sol` contract calculates the amount of shares to mint with the `previewMint` function.
The `previewMint` function does the calculation with the `convertToAssets` function and in `convertToAssets` function, the calculation is done this way;
```solidity
function convertToAssets(uint256 shares) public view override returns (uint256 assets) {
        return exchangeRate().mul(shares).div(EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION); //@audit div was earlier done in exchangeRate()
    }
```
Note that `exchangeRate()` was called before multiplying by shares. The point is that in the `exchangeRate()` there was a division before the returned value was multiplied by `shares` in the function above. When it involves multiplication and division, all multiplications should be implemented first before all the divison implemented at the end in order not to lose precision.
See the `exchangeRate()` function where the division was first done before a mulitiplicaiton in `convertToAssets` function
```solidity
    function exchangeRate() public view returns (uint256 rate) {
        uint256 totalValueExternal = _getTotalValueExternal();
        uint256 supply = _totalSupply();
        // Exchange Rate from token to Underlying in EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION is:
        // 1 token = totalValueExternal * EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION / totalSupply
        rate = totalValueExternal.mul(EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION).div(supply);
    }
```
## Impact
Lower than normal or zero shares maybe minted to a user due to rounding down/loss of precision.
## Code Snippet
The exchangeRate function where the first division was done by `totalsupply`.
- [exachangeRate Function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/external/proxies/BaseERC4626Proxy.sol#L303-L309)
```solidity
function exchangeRate() public view returns (uint256 rate) {
        uint256 totalValueExternal = _getTotalValueExternal();
        uint256 supply = _totalSupply();
        // Exchange Rate from token to Underlying in EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION is:
        // 1 token = totalValueExternal * EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION / totalSupply
        rate = totalValueExternal.mul(EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION).div(supply);
    }
```

The `convertToAsset` function where the result of the above `exchangeRate` function was multiplied by `shares`.
-  [convertToAsset Function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/external/proxies/BaseERC4626Proxy.sol#L163-L165)
```solidity
function convertToAssets(uint256 shares) public view override returns (uint256 assets) {
        return exchangeRate().mul(shares).div(EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION); //@audit div in exchangeRate() before mul by shares
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Always implement all multiplication first before all the divisions are implemented to avoid unnecessary loss of precison.
