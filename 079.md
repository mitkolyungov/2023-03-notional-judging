## Summary:Inaccurate conversion methods used  in the maths libraries.

## Vulnerability Detail:
**1)The contract safeUint256 one of the libraries for conversion of data types,implements a wrong method for the conversion of uint256 to uint72.In the function toUint72(),one of the requirement for conversion is the value to convert being less than type(uint8).max which is 255.Since it is a conversion from uint256 to uint72 it logically makes sense that  the range of values convertible should be type(uint72).min-type(uint72).max which widens the range of conversion and  solves truncation  which could lead to precision loss.
**2)The second issue:In the contract safeint256 function abs() which returns the absolute value of any number.It does this by checking if the value is a negative number then multiplying the number by -1 and if positive returning the number but in cases where the number is type(int256).min the call will fail because since it is a negative value it is multiplied by -1 and +(type(int256).min) is not compatible with int256.

## Impact
1):Limits the range of numbers that could be converted to uint72 and since there is already a conversion to uint8 i suppose this should be used by higher values which would instantly fail because of check.
2):Calls for conversion to abs() with input data of type(int).min will always revert with the calls

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1):Instead of checking if x is <= than type(uint8).max check if x is within the range of uint72.min and uint72.max to prevent truncation
2):Add check x!=type(int256).min
