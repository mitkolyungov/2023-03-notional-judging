# Incorrect accounting for idle funds during prime cash withdrawals

## Summary
When users withdraw prime cash for underlying, the protocol may liquidate external money market tokens to satisfy the withdrawal request. However, the current accounting process does not correctly account for idle funds during withdrawals. This can lead to incorrect redemption amounts, causing withdrawal failures for users when there are insufficient funds in the external money markets.
## Vulnerability Detail
When withdrawing prime cash for underlying, if the required underlying is not available, Notional will start redemption process which will be liquidating its external money market tokens (aave,compound,euler,yearn) to underlying to satisfy users withdrawal process. However, the accounting is not correct when doing the redemption. Idle funds are not accounted on the withdrawal amount. 

First, let's see when idle DAI can happen, currently I see two possibilities:
1- Governance rebalances/deposits idle DAI to money markets in proportion and after some time other people joins and their DAI is idle until the next time rebalance will be called from governance
2- Governance decides some portion of DAI is should be kept idle on Notional maybe because not to commit fully for safety or make withdrawals easy in case of high utilization on other markets where redeeming DAI is problematic.

Now, considering this, lets do an example scenario where accounting is wrong;

Assume Alice deposits 50 DAI and receives 50 pDAI and for simplicity I'll treat 1 pDAI(primecash) as 1DAI but in reality it will be higher than 1 DAI since it's earning interest through notional interests + external money market interests. 

Governance deposits the 50 DAI to compound v2. Up to that point, notional has only Alice as depositor. At some time later, Alice decides to deposit 50 more DAI and some other people joins her and the total DAI deposited in Notional is 149 DAI whereas 50 DAI in Compound in form cDAI and 99 DAI is idle in Notional waiting for governance to rebalance/deposit to external money markets. And again assume throughout the scenarios pDAI:DAI 1:1. That means Alice has 100 pDAI.

If Alice would try to withdraw her 100 pDAI for underlying and calls the _AccountActions.sol_ `withdraw()` function, let's see what happens.

will be called

and then TokenHandler's `withdrawPrimeCash`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/balances/TokenHandler.sol#L238
here, the underlying DAI needed will be calculated and since we said 1pDAI is 1DAI we will liquidate 100DAI for Alice

here is the problematic line 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/balances/TokenHandler.sol#L265
It checks if the idle DAI amount is sufficient to satisfy Alice's withdrawal. Alice needs 100DAI and idle funds are 99DAI since if check not satisfied now contract tries to liquidate 100DAI from the external money markets although it only has 50 DAI worth of cTokens. As we see the redemption call data also focuses on the entire amount which is 100DAI. This will revert since there are not enough cTokens to redeem for 100DAI in external money markets. Alice needs to wait for governance to deposit the idle tokens to strategy so she can full withdraw. Up to then, Alice can't make a full withdrawal although the funds are totally available in Notional even in an easier shape (vanilla DAI).



 
## Impact
In general idle balance should be accounted carefully since redeeming from external markets are way more complex and riskier than just giving the idle funds you have. As seen in above example, redeeming only 1DAI worth of cTokens should be sufficient to cover Alice's required underlying amount.

## Recommendation
Redeem the `needed - idle` portion of funds from external money markets.
