# Initial Prime Cash exchange rate can be manipulated

## Summary
Initial Prime Cash exchange rate can be manipulated.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
   // Will set the initial token balance storage to whatever is on the contract at the time
        // of migration.
        PrimeCashExchangeRate.initTokenBalanceStorage(currencyId, settings.primeCashOracle);

        // Any dust underlying token balances will be donated to the prime supply and aggregated into
        // the underlying scalar value. There is currently some dust ETH balance on Notional that will
        // get donated to all prime cash holders.
        uint88 currentAssetTokenBalance = assetToken.convertToInternal(
            IERC20(assetToken.tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this)).toInt()
        ).toUint().toUint88();

        // NOTE: at time of upgrade there cannot be any negative cash balances. This can be
        // guaranteed by ensuring that all accounts and negative cash balances are settled
        // before the upgrade is executed. There is no way for the contract to verify that
        // this is the case, must rely on governance to ensure that this occurs.
        PrimeCashExchangeRate.initPrimeCashCurve({
            currencyId: currencyId,
            // The initial prime supply will be set by the current balance of the asset tokens
            // in internal precision. currentAssetTokenBalance / currentTotalUnderlying (both in
            // 8 decimal precision) will set the initial basis for the underlyingScalar. This
            // ensures that all existing cash balances remain in the correct precision.
            totalPrimeSupply: currentAssetTokenBalance,
            // These settings must be set on the implementation storage prior to the upgrade.
            debtCurve: settings.primeDebtCurve,
            oracle: settings.primeCashOracle,
            allowDebt: settings.allowPrimeDebt,
            rateOracleTimeWindow5Min: settings.rateOracleTimeWindow5Min
        });
```
because the initial supply is derived from IERC20(assetToken.tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this)), the initial prime cash exchange rate can be manipulated.

a malicious user can manipulate the initial supply and because this is vital in determining the exchange rate, therefore a malicious user can effectively manipulate the exchange rate of prime cash for his own gains.

this is done by inflating the supply of an underlying erc20 token.
the calculation of supply will then devalue prime cash.
## Impact
a malicious user can effectively manipulate the exchange rate of prime cash for his own gain, leading to a loss of funds for other users of the protocol.
