# _getNetCashAmountsUnderlying() uses the wrong utilization and thus might return the wrong net underlying cash amounts to the account, the market and the reserve.

## Summary
``_getNetCashAmountsUnderlying()`` uses the wrong utilization and thus might return the wrong net underlying cash amounts to the account, the market and the reserve.  The main problem is the function applies ``fCashToAccount`` to ``market.totalfCash`` to cuculate the utilization, which allows a user to manipulate the input ``fCashToAccount`` to affect utlization, interest rates, and then the final returned net underlying cash amounts. 

## Vulnerability Detail
To see how a user might manipulate the input ``fCashToAccount`` to get the net underlying cash amounts in his favor to win in a trade, consider the following steps: 

1. ``_getNetCashAmountsUnderlying()`` is used to calculate the net underlying cash amounts to the account, the market and the reserve. The function is called by  ``calculatefCashTrade()``, so returning the correct values are critical to have a fair trade. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/markets/InterestRateCurve.sol#L421-L474](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/markets/InterestRateCurve.sol#L421-L474)

2. ``_getNetCashAmountsUnderlying()`` calls ``getfCashUtilization(fCashToAccount, market.totalfCash, totalCashUnderlying)`` to calculate the utilization. This is a problem, ``fCashToAccount`` will be applied to ``martket.totalfCash`` to calculate the utilization and as a result, the returned utilization is the one that is AFTER the trade, not BEFOFRE the trade. We should calculate the utilization BEFORE the trade here and calls ``getfCashUtilization(0, market.totalfCash, totalCashUnderlying)`` instead. Otherwise, the user can use ``fCashToAccount`` to manipulate the utilization and get favorable interest rates (which are based on utilization).

```javascript
 function getfCashUtilization(
        int256 fCashToAccount,
        int256 totalfCash,
        int256 totalCashUnderlying
    ) internal pure returns (uint256 utilization) {
        require(totalfCash >= 0);
        require(totalCashUnderlying >= 0);
        utilization = totalfCash.subNoNeg(fCashToAccount)
            .divInRatePrecision(totalCashUnderlying.add(totalfCash))
            .toUint();
    }
```
3. ``_getNetCashAmountsUnderlying()`` will use the above utilization to calculate ``preFeeCashToAccount``,  ``postFeeInterestRate`` and then finally the net underlying cash amounts to the account, the market and the reserve. Therefore, by controlling ``fCashToAccount``, different utilization and interest rates will be used to these trade values. This is a serious security problem. 


## Impact
``_getNetCashAmountsUnderlying()`` uses the wrong utilization and thus might return the wrong net underlying cash amounts to the account, the market and the reserve.  Malicious users can manipulate ``fCashToAccount`` to affect utilization and interest rates and steal funds from the protocol.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use before-trade utilization always during a trade:
```diff
function _getNetCashAmountsUnderlying(
        InterestRateParameters memory irParams,
        MarketParameters memory market,
        CashGroupParameters memory cashGroup,
        int256 totalCashUnderlying,
        int256 fCashToAccount,
        uint256 timeToMaturity
    ) private pure returns (int256 postFeeCashToAccount, int256 netUnderlyingToMarket, int256 cashToReserve) {
-        uint256 utilization = getfCashUtilization(fCashToAccount, market.totalfCash, totalCashUnderlying);
+        uint256 utilization = getfCashUtilization(fCashToAccount, market.totalfCash, totalCashUnderlying);
 

       // Do not allow utilization to go above 100 on trading
        if (utilization > uint256(Constants.RATE_PRECISION)) return (0, 0, 0);
        uint256 preFeeInterestRate = getInterestRate(irParams, utilization);

        int256 preFeeCashToAccount = fCashToAccount.divInRatePrecision(
            getfCashExchangeRate(preFeeInterestRate, timeToMaturity)
        ).neg();

        uint256 postFeeInterestRate = getPostFeeInterestRate(irParams, preFeeInterestRate, fCashToAccount < 0);
        postFeeCashToAccount = fCashToAccount.divInRatePrecision(
            getfCashExchangeRate(postFeeInterestRate, timeToMaturity)
        ).neg();

        require(postFeeCashToAccount <= preFeeCashToAccount);
        // Both pre fee cash to account and post fee cash to account are either negative (lending) or positive
        // (borrowing). Fee will be positive or zero as a result.
        int256 fee = preFeeCashToAccount.sub(postFeeCashToAccount);

        cashToReserve = fee.mul(cashGroup.getReserveFeeShare()).div(Constants.PERCENTAGE_DECIMALS);

        // This inequality must hold inside given the fees:
        //  netToMarket + cashToReserve + postFeeCashToAccount = 0

        // Example: Lending
        // Pre Fee Cash: -97 ETH
        // Post Fee Cash: -100 ETH
        // Fee: 3 ETH
        // To Reserve: 1 ETH
        // Net To Market = 99 ETH
        // 99 + 1 - 100 == 0

        // Example: Borrowing
        // Pre Fee Cash: 100 ETH
        // Post Fee Cash: 97 ETH
        // Fee: 3 ETH
        // To Reserve: 1 ETH
        // Net To Market = -98 ETH
        // 97 + 1 - 98 == 0

        // Therefore:
        //  netToMarket = - cashToReserve - postFeeCashToAccount
        //  netToMarket = - (cashToReserve + postFeeCashToAccount)

        netUnderlyingToMarket = (postFeeCashToAccount.add(cashToReserve)).neg();
    }
```
