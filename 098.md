# call data to enter or exit market is never generated When executing rebalancing in TreasuryAction

## Summary
call data to enter or exit market is never generated
## Vulnerability Detail
the function `getDepositCalldata` never generates calldata for entering an exiting compounds markets, this can be observed in the snippet below
```solidity
function getDepositCalldata(
        address from,
        address assetToken,
        address assetRateAdapter,
        uint256 rateAdapterPrecision,
        uint256 depositUnderlyingAmount,
        bool underlyingIsETH
    ) internal view returns (DepositData[] memory data) {
        address[] memory targets = new address[](1);
        bytes[] memory callData = new bytes[](1);
        uint256[] memory msgValue = new uint256[](1);

        targets[0] = assetToken;
        msgValue[0] = underlyingIsETH ? depositUnderlyingAmount : 0;
        callData[0] = abi.encodeWithSelector(
            underlyingIsETH ? CEtherInterface.mint.selector : CErc20Interface.mint.selector, 
            depositUnderlyingAmount
        );

        data = new DepositData[](1);
        data[0] = DepositData(targets, callData, msgValue, depositUnderlyingAmount, assetToken);
    }
```
since no calldata for entering and exiting the compound markets is ever generated, it is impossible to enter the market rendering the function useless. Users of the protocol will be unable to correctly enter markets because of this

entering markets is vital for supplying collateral as stated in the Compound docs
https://docs.compound.finance/v2/comptroller/
>Enter into a list of markets - it is not an error to enter the same market more than once. In order to supply collateral or borrow in a market, it must be entered first.

Notional wants to deposit asset and mint cToken and supply assets to generate interest rate and return for the user and also to accrue COMP token reward as well, this is core functionality of the protocol.

This is the desired outcome but because markets are never entered the above statement is impossible

Users will miss out on return and accrural of COMP tokens. This is a direct loss of funds for the user.
## Impact
Because entering a market is crucial for minting cToken, the lack of calldata for entering markets will cause users to not accrue interest and COMP tokens, this is a direct loss of funds for the user.

## Recommendation
We recommend generating calldata to enter and exit markets
