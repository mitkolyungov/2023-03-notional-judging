# Unchecked Return Value in _convertToAmountExternal

## Summary

The return value of the token.convertToInternal function is not checked in the _convertToAmountExternal function, potentially leading to incorrect results.

## Vulnerability Detail

The _convertToAmountExternal function calls token.convertToInternal(depositAmount), but it does not check if the conversion was successful or if the return value is within the expected range.

## Impact

Incorrect conversions could lead to unintended consequences such as incorrect deposit amounts or undesired calculations, potentially causing financial losses for users or vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add checks to ensure that the return value of token.convertToInternal is within the expected range and handle any exceptions or errors that might occur during the conversion. Consider using SafeMath or similar libraries to perform arithmetic operations safely.
