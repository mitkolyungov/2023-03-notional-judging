# Use of safeApprove might cause initialize to revert

## Summary
The safeApprove method is used inside the initialize. However, this function is deprecated and might cause the function to revert.
## Vulnerability Detail
BaseERC4626Proxy uses  OpenZeppelinâ€™s safeApprove() within the initialize uses which has been documented as 1) Deprecated because of approve-like race condition and 2) To be used only for initial setting of allowance (current allowance == 0) or resetting to 0 because it reverts otherwise. You can find a detailed explanation inside the OpenZeppelin GitHub:

## Impact
Using this deprecated function can lead to unintended reverts and potentially the locking of funds.

## Recommendation
