# `block.number` cannot be used as a reliable source of timing information

## Summary
`block.number` is used as a reliable source of timing information which would not be possible on Optimism currently.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the README is mentionned that Notional's team is considering deploying the protocol to Arbitrum and Optimisim in the near future.

In the current implementation of NotionalV3, the exchange rate of cToken can be retrieved using `_viewExchangeRate`:
```solidity
function  getExchangeRateView() external  view override returns (int256) {

// Return stored exchange rate if interest rate model is updated.

// This prevents the function from returning incorrect exchange rates

uint256 exchangeRate = cToken.interestRateModel() == INTEREST_RATE_MODEL

? _viewExchangeRate()

: cToken.exchangeRateStored();

_checkExchangeRate(exchangeRate);

  

return  int256(exchangeRate);

}
```

In `_viewExchangeRate`, `block.number` is used to perform the calculation:
```solidity
/// @dev adapted from https://github.com/transmissions11/libcompound/blob/main/src/LibCompound.sol

function  _viewExchangeRate() private  view  returns (uint256) {

uint256 accrualBlockNumberPrior = cToken.accrualBlockNumber();

  

if (accrualBlockNumberPrior == block.number) return cToken.exchangeRateStored();

  

uint256 totalCash = cToken.getCash();

uint256 borrowsPrior = cToken.totalBorrows();

uint256 reservesPrior = cToken.totalReserves();

  

// There are two versions of this method depending on the interest rate model that

// have different return signatures.

uint256 borrowRateMantissa = _getBorrowRate(totalCash, borrowsPrior, reservesPrior);

  

require(borrowRateMantissa <= 0.0005e16, "RATE_TOO_HIGH"); // Same as borrowRateMaxMantissa in CTokenInterfaces.sol

  

// Interest accumulated = (borrowRate * blocksSinceLastAccrual * borrowsPrior) / 1e18

uint256 interestAccumulated = borrowRateMantissa

.mul(block.number.sub(accrualBlockNumberPrior))

.mul(borrowsPrior)

.div(1e18);

  

// Total Reserves = total reserves prior + (interestAccumulated * reserveFactor) / 1e18

uint256 totalReserves = cToken.reserveFactorMantissa().mul(interestAccumulated).div(1e18).add(reservesPrior);

// Total borrows = interestAccumulated + borrowsPrior

uint256 totalBorrows = interestAccumulated.add(borrowsPrior);

uint256 totalSupply = cToken.totalSupply();

  

// exchangeRate = ((totalCash + totalBorrows - totalReserves) * 1e18) / totalSupply

// https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/CToken.sol#L350

return

totalSupply == 0

? cToken.initialExchangeRateMantissa()

: (totalCash.add(totalBorrows).sub(totalReserves)).mul(1e18).div(totalSupply);

}
```

In the calculation, `block.number` is used as a reliable source of timing information. However as this section of the [Optimism](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/build/differences/#block-numbers-and-timestamps) docs state:

> ### Block production is not constant

>On Ethereum, the  `NUMBER`  opcode (`block.number`  in Solidity) corresponds to the current Ethereum block number. Similarly, in Optimism,  `block.number`  corresponds to the current L2 block number. However, as of the OVM 2.0 release of Optimism (Nov. 2021),  **each transaction on L2 is placed in a separate block and blocks are NOT produced at a constant rate.**

>This is important because it means that  `block.number`  is currently NOT a reliable source of timing information. If you want access to the current time, you should use  `block.timestamp`  (the  `TIMESTAMP`  opcode) instead.

## Impact
If an exchange rate calculation is performed on Optimism using the same code it will lead to a different exchange rate which will overvalue or undervalue the cToken.

## Recommendation

Make sure to not use `block.number` as a reliable source of timing information if the protocol is deployed on Optimism.
