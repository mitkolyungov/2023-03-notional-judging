# Dependency Confusion Attack Deu to Unclamed Package

## Summary
A dependency confusion attack is a type of software supply chain attack that targets organizations using both public and private package managers to manage their software dependencies.

In this attack, the attacker uploads a malicious package to a public package manager that has the same name as a legitimate package used by the target organization. The attacker assumes that the organization uses a private package manager that fetches the package from the public manager first and then falls back to the private one if the package is not found in the public manager.

## Vulnerability Detail
contracts-v2 package, with the name "contracts-v2" found on https://github.com/notional-finance/contracts-v2/blob/b20a45c912785fab5f2b62992e5260f44dbae197/package.json, is unclaimed on the NPM package. This leaves the package vulnerable to a Dependency Confusion Attack. An attacker can claim the package and upload malicious code under that unclaimed package. This results in achieving remote code execution on developers/users' machines who depend on this package.
