## Vulnerability Detail
``addLiquidity()`` allows a user to add liquidity to a market, assuming that it is initialized.

However, the following statements have a divide-by-error error when market.totalPrimeCash = 0.

```javascript
 liquidityTokens = market.totalLiquidity.mul(primeCash).div(market.totalPrimeCash);
        // No need to convert this to underlying, primeCash / totalPrimeCash is a unitless proportion.
        fCash = market.totalfCash.mul(primeCash).div(market.totalPrimeCash);
```


## Impact
``Market#addLiquidity()`` has a divide-by-zero error when ``market.totalPrimeCash = 0``.

## Recommendation
Deal with the case of market.totalPrimeCash = 0 so that divide-by-error will not occur.
