# There is no slippage control when redeeming cTokens for underlying

## Summary
There is no slippage control when redeeming cTokens for underlying
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
  function depositDeprecatedAssetToken(
        Token memory assetToken,
        uint16 currencyId,
        uint256 assetAmountExternal,
        address account,
        PrimeRate memory primeRate
    ) internal returns (int256 primeCashDeposited) {
        // Transfer the asset token into the contract
        assetAmountExternal = GenericToken.safeTransferIn(
            assetToken.tokenAddress, account, assetAmountExternal
        );

        Token memory underlyingToken = getUnderlyingToken(currencyId);
        int256 underlyingExternalAmount;
        // Only cTokens will be listed at the time of the migration. Redeem
        // those cTokens to underlying (to be held by the Notional contract)
        // and then run the post transfer update
        if (assetToken.tokenType == TokenType.cETH) {
            underlyingExternalAmount = CompoundHandler.redeemCETH(
                assetToken, assetAmountExternal
            ).toInt();
        } else if (assetToken.tokenType == TokenType.cToken) {
            underlyingExternalAmount = CompoundHandler.redeem(
                assetToken, underlyingToken, assetAmountExternal
            ).toInt();
        } else {
            // No other asset token variants can be called here.
            revert();
        }
        
        primeCashDeposited = _postTransferPrimeCashUpdate(
            account, currencyId, underlyingExternalAmount, underlyingToken, primeRate
        );
    }

```
in the function above we can observe that cTokens are being redeemed for their underlying token.

As we know cTokens are subject to change of exchange rate of their underlying token. 

in the function there is no deadline checks or slippage control. Users funds may be redeemed for a less optimal price and this will lead to a loss of their potential funds.
## Impact
Users may redeem their cTokens for a less optimal rate than they should. This is a loss of funds for the user

## Recommendation
We recommend to add a slippage control.
