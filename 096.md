# NO STORAGE GAP FOR UPGRADEABLE CONTRACTS

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
 upgradeable abstract contracts, inheriting contracts may introduce new variables. In order to be able to add new variables to the upgradeable abstract contract without causing storage collisions, a storage gap should be added to the upgradeable abstract contract.

## Impact
If no storage gap is added, when the upgradable abstract contract introduces new variables, it may override the variables in the inheriting contract.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/external/patchfix/BasePatchFixRouter.sol#L12

```solidity
abstract contract BasePatchFixRouter is UUPSUpgradeable {
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a storage gap at the end of the upgradeable abstract contract

```solidity
uint256[50] private __gap;
```
