# ERC20 tokens transfer implementation

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

There are many tokens that do not return a `bool` on ERC20 methods. When we implement transfer functions that expects a `true` or `false` return values, at times we many never get to execute the subsequent lines of code. With a conditional statement that checks for the `bool` return values, the function can lead to expected actions. The statements under `if` conditions may never get executed due to this issue.

## Impact

ERC20 tokens can get stuck in the contract.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
 function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external override returns (bool ret) {
        ret = _transfer(to, amount);
        if (ret) emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
    }

    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external override returns (bool ret) {
        ret = _transferFrom(from, to, amount);
        if (ret) emit Transfer(from, to, amount);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Handles the return value check for many other non-standard ERC20 tokens as well.
