# Potential Imbalance in Notional V3's Initial Supply After Migration

## Summary
When the migration will take place, the initial prime supply will be set to the balance of asset tokens and the further deposits will be based on the underlyings which will cause uneven prime supply.
## Vulnerability Detail
After the migration to Notional V3, the initial prime supply is set equal to the assetToken balance of Notional V2, and the underlying scalar is calculated as the ratio of totalUnderlyingStored to primeSupply. As per the documentation, we can find the total underlyings at any given time using the formula provided:

However, since the initial prime supply is determined by the assetToken amount and future deposits are based on the underlying amount, there seems to be a potential discrepancy between prime supply and underlying values.

Consider the following scenario:

Prior to migration, we have 100 cDAI assetTokens for DAI and 10 DAI underlying. After the migration, the initial prime supply of DAI is 100 (equal to the cDAI balance). The underlyingScalar becomes 0.1 (10/100), and the supplyScalar starts at 1.

At this point, we have 100 cDAI and 100 pDAI, meaning that 1 cDAI equals 1 pDAI.

Let's assume Alice deposits 50 DAI into Notional V3 soon after migration, with minimal interest accrued during this time. Alice's netUnderlyingChange is 50 DAI, and the conversion from underlying to prime tokens also yields 50 pDAI. Alice thus receives 50 pDAI for her 50 DAI deposit.

However, this creates an inconsistency. Before Alice's deposit, 1 cDAI (which equals 0.2 DAI) equated to 1 pDAI. However, Alice got 1pDAI for 1DAI deposit.

Recomputing the balance storages using the formula, we find that totalPrimeSupply is 150 (100 initial plus Alice's 50), underlyingScalar is 0.4 (60/150), and supplyScalar is approximately 1 (considering minimal time has passed since migration).

According to this, there should be 60 DAI in Notional V3 (150 * 0.4 * 1). However, we actually have 80 DAI (50 from Alice, 20 equivalent from 100 cDAI, plus the initial 10 DAI).

In summary, it appears there could be a potential imbalance between the prime supply and the underlying values in Notional V3 after migration due to the difference in how the initial prime supply and future deposits are calculated.

Even further, let's assume Bob comes and borrows 60 prime cash which is 60pDAI and the 60DAI is available in contract (Alice + init) hence, no need to perform redemptions.

Now assume Alice also wants to borrow 20 DAI, contracts will calculate as for 20DAI Alice needs to borrow 10 pDAI, 
When this tx executes, redemptions will take place and 100cDAI will be liquidated for 20DAI and will sent to Alice.

After all these tx's:
underlyingTokenStorage = 0 (no DAI left)
assetTokenStorage = 0 (no cDAI left)
totalPrimeSupply = 70 
 
 Which is clearly a conflict, (how can prime supply > 0 when there is no assets)
## Impact
Currently the cDAI/DAI ratio is 0.02 but for the sake of the example I used 0.2, it does not really have any affect on what the exchange rate is, as long as exchange rate is not 1:1 with the underlying this issue will be valid.

## Recommendation
Start the initial prime supply as 
`assetTokenBalance * assetTokenExchangePrice`
