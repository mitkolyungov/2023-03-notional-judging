# re-entrancy from ``transferCashToVaultLiquidator`` function adversary can drain funds

## Summary
the modern re-entrancy is often a bug problem in some smart contracts such as cross re-entrancy.
the library ``SettleAssetsExternal`` contains a function that contains the cross re-entrancy vulnerability ``transferCashToVaultLiquidator``.

## Vulnerability Detail
the ``transferCashToVaultLiquidator`` function in the ``SettleAssetsExternal`` library has an incorrect pattern in execution.
```solidity
        // The vault is transferring prime cash to the liquidator in exchange for cash.
        Emitter.emitTransferPrimeCash(vault, liquidator, currencyId, cashToLiquidator);
        // fCashToVault is positive here. The liquidator will transfer fCash to the vault
        // and the vault will burn it to repay negative fCash debt.
        Emitter.emitTransferfCash(liquidator, vault, currencyId, maturity, fCashToVault);
        // The account will burn its debt and vault cash
        Emitter.emitVaultAccountCashBurn(
            account, vault, currencyId, maturity, fCashToVault, cashToLiquidator
        );
```
 ``VaultAccountCashBurn`` is at the end of execution can make the adversary take advantage here to drain funds.
The adversary can transfer funds to the vault liquidator repeatedly before ``VaultAccountCash`` is burned, because ``VaultAccountCashBurn`` executes last 

## Impact
adversary can stole funds by sending funds to the liquidator repeatedly.

## Code Snippet
`transferCashToVaultLiquidator()` burning execution at the end, at line 131-133

The `transferCashToVaultLiquidator()` called from the `VaultLiquidationAction.sol` contract in the `_transferCashToVault` function also does not implement the CHECK EFFECT INTERACTION pattern correctly.
in this case `transferCashToVaultLiquidator` is the interaction that should be executed last.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. make changes to the function ``transferCashToVaultLiquidator`` do a burn first before sending funds.
using ``Checks-Effects-Interactions`` correctly

2. in ``_transferCashToVault``  change like this:
```solidity
 function _transferCashToVault(
        VaultAccount memory vaultAccount,
        address liquidator,
        address vault,
        uint16 currencyId,
        int256 fCashDeposit,
        int256 cashToLiquidator
    ) internal {

        bool mustCheckFC;  // CHECK //

        if (mustCheckFC) {  // EFFECT //
            FreeCollateralExternal.checkFreeCollateralAndRevert(liquidator);
        }

        SettleAssetsExternal.transferCashToVaultLiquidator(  // INTERACTION //
            liquidator, vault, vaultAccount.account, currencyId, vaultAccount.maturity, fCashDeposit, cashToLiquidator
        );
        emit VaultAccountCashLiquidation(
            vault, vaultAccount.account, liquidator, currencyId, fCashDeposit, cashToLiquidator
        );
    }
```
