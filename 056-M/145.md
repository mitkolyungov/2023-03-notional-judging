# Issues in `BaseERC4626Proxy`contract

## Summary

* `BaseERC4626Proxy.mint` function doesn't comply to the ERC4626 specification, breaking composability.
* Rounding issue in `BaseERC4626Proxy.previewMint`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `BaseERC4626Proxy.mint` function violates the ERC4626 specification ([https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626)):

> ### mint
>Mints exactly `shares` Vault shares to `receiver` by depositing `assets` of underlying tokens.

However the current implementation will mint less `shares` to the `receiver` under various circumstances:

1) When the `BaseERC4626Proxy.previewMint` is rounding down.
2) When the underlying asset is a fee-on-transfer token.

Currently it is not guaranteed that the `BaseERC4626Proxy.mint` function will mint exactly `shares` Vault shares to `receiver`, because it is calling the `BaseERC4626Proxy.previewMint` function that is underestimating the assets by rounding down, which may result in less shares issued for the user.

Additionally, the `BaseERC4626Proxy.previewMint` function should return a rounded up value, according to the EIP 4626's Security Considerations ([https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626)):

> Finally, EIP-4626 Vault implementers should be aware of the need for specific, opposing rounding directions across the different mutable and view methods, as it is considered most secure to favor the Vault itself during calculations over its users:<br><ul><li>If (1) it’s calculating how many shares to issue to a user for a certain amount of the underlying tokens they provide or (2) it’s determining the amount of the underlying tokens to transfer to them for returning a certain amount of shares, it should round down.<br><li> If (1) it’s calculating the amount of shares a user has to supply to receive a given amount of the underlying tokens or (2) it’s calculating the amount of underlying tokens a user has to provide to receive a certain amount of shares, it should round up.</ul>

However, `BaseERC4626Proxy.previewMint` is returning a rounded down value, because it is calling the function `BaseERC4626Proxy.convertToAssets` which is rounding down.

## Impact

Other protocols which use Notional will expect, that the exact amount of `shares` will be issued when minting. However, when less shares are minted other protocols may face accounting issues which can result in loss of funds.

This problem also occurs when the asset is a fee-on-transfer token.

Additionally, other protocols that integrate with Notional might wrongly assume that the `BaseERC4626Proxy.previewMint` function handles rounding as per ERC4626 specification. Other protocols will use the `BaseERC4626Proxy.previewMint` function in order to determine, how many assets should be approved or transferred. A deviation from EIP4626 breaks composability and potentially leads to loss of funds.

#### Example:

* User wants to mint 1 share

* previewMint rounds down to 0 assets that the user has to provide

* mint function will not issue any shares for the 0 assets given.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- The `BaseERC4626Proxy.mint` function should follow the ERC4626 specification.

- The function `BaseERC4626Proxy.previewMint` should return a rounded up value.
