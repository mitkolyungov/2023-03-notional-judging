# Unrestricted Access to `executeVaultTrade()`

## Summary
The `executeVaultTrade()` function in the given contract is currently callable by any address without any access control. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Based on `executeVaultTrade()` in `TradingAction.sol`
```solidity 
function executeVaultTrade(uint16 currencyId, address vault, bytes32 trade) external {...}
``` 
An attacker could exploit the function by executing trades on behalf of a vault without the vault owner's consent. This could lead to unauthorized trades and manipulation of the vault's funds.

1. Assume Alice is an attacker and is aware of the missing access control in the executeVaultTrade() function.
2. Alice monitors the contract for active vaults and their associated currency IDs 
3. Alice constructs a malicious trade parameter that would result in an unfavorable trade for the vault owner, say, by lending at a very low rate or borrowing at a very high rate.
4. Alice calls `executeVaultTrade()` with the malicious trade parameter, specifying the target vault address and currency ID.
5. Since there is no access control, the trade is executed on behalf of the vault, potentially causing harm to the vault owner.

## Impact
The absence of access control on the `executeVaultTrade()` function can allow an attacker to spam the function with numerous calls, which could lead to unnecessary gas costs for the contract and potential issues with rate limits and slippage.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement access control for the `executeVaultTrade()` function by adding a modifier that checks if the caller is authorized to execute trades on behalf of the vault
