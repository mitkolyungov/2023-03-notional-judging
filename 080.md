# getfCashLendFromDeposit(uint16 currencyId, uint256 depositAmountExternal, uint256 maturity, uint32 minLendRate, uint256 blockTime, bool useUnderlying)

## Summary
getfCashLendFromDeposit(uint16 currencyId, uint256 depositAmountExternal, uint256 maturity, uint32 minLendRate, uint256 blockTime, bool useUnderlying)

## Vulnerability Detail
if underlyingInternal is the minimum representable value for its data type (e.g. -2^127 for a signed 128-bit integer), then its negation would be greater than the maximum representable value (e.g. 2^127-1), which would result in an overflow and incorrect calculation.

## Impact
High - integer overflow

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use SafeMath for arithmetic operations and ensure that underlyingInternal.neg() does not overflow.
