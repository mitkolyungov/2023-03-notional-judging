# Initial depositor can manipulate the price per share value and future depositors are forced to deposit huge value in vault.

## Summary
Most of the share based vault implementation will face this issue.
The vault is based on the ERC4626 where the shares are calculated based on the deposit value.
By depositing large amount as initial deposit, initial depositor can influence the future depositors value.

## Vulnerability Detail
Shares are minted based on the deposit value.
Public vault is based on the ERC4626 where the shares are calculated based on the deposit value.

By depositing large amount as initial deposit, first depositor can take advantage over other depositors.

I am sharing reference for this type of issue that already reported and acknowledged. This explain how the share price could be manipulated to large value.

## Impact
Future depositors are forced for huge value of asset to deposit. It is not practically possible for all the users.
This could directly affect on the attrition of users towards this system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider requiring a minimal amount of share tokens to be minted for the first minter, and send a portion of the initial mints as a reserve to the DAO/ burn so that the price per share can be more resistant to manipulation.
