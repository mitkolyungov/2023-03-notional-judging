# depositUnderlyingExternal() lacks slippage control, as a result, the user might lose funds due to frontrunning from other prime rate changing transactions.

## Summary
``depositUnderlyingExternal()`` lacks slippage control, as a result, the user might lose funds due to frontrunning from other prime rate changing transactions. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The ``depositUnderlyingExternal()`` function allows a user to deposit an amount of underlying tokens to mint prime cash. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/balances/TokenHandler.sol#L176-L210](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/balances/TokenHandler.sol#L176-L210)

However, the function lacks a slippage control, therefore, it might receive less prime cash than the user expected. For example, when a user Frank runs this function to deposit some underlying tokens, it might be front-run by other transactions that change the prime rate (other deposit/withdraw transactions or configuration change transaction such as the change of ``setRateOracleTimeWindow``.) 

In summary, ``depositUnderlyingExternal()`` lacks slippage control, as a result, if it is front-run by other transactions that change the prime rate,  the user might receive less prime cash than expected. 

## Impact
``depositUnderlyingExternal()`` lacks slippage control, as a result, the user might lose funds due to frontrunning from other prime rate changing transactions.
