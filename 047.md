# New deposits are not deposited to external money markets

## Summary

New deposits are not deposited to external money markets

## Vulnerability Detail

The only place where deposits to external markets are made is in `_executeRebalance`.

Therefore, when the user deposits via `AccountAction.depositUnderlyingToken / depositAssetToken`, her tokens will stay in Notional unutilized.

The TreasuryManager has to call `rebalance` manually to utilise the tokens.

## Impact

Protocol loses from potential rewards, until rebalance is called again.

If rebalancing targets are set, and users make considerable deposits, then the lost value could also be considerable.

For instance, for 80% target, where 1mil USDC has been deposited to Notional. Rewards in external markets are 10%.

- Current utiliziation: 80% - 800k is deposited to external markets
- Now a whale deposits 5mil USDC. Total utilisation could be 6*0.8=4.8mil
- In one week, the protocol loses 4mil$ / 52(weeks in a year) = 8000$ from potential rewards.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function depositUnderlyingToken(
        address account,
        uint16 currencyId,
        uint256 amountExternalPrecision
    ) external payable nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
		... // no deposit here

}

function _executeRebalance(uint16 currencyId) private {
		...
		// deposits are only executed in rebalance()
    // Process deposits
    _executeDeposits(underlyingToken, data.depositData);
		...
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

On each deposit, check the current rebalancing targets, and deposit to the target that is filled the least.
