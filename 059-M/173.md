# getAccountPrimeDebtBalance() always return 0

## Summary
Spelling errors that result in `getAccountPrimeDebtBalance()` Always return 0

## Vulnerability Detail

`getAccountPrimeDebtBalance()` use for Show current debt

```solidity
    function getAccountPrimeDebtBalance(uint16 currencyId, address account) external view override returns (
        int256 debtBalance
    ) {
        mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => BalanceStorage)) storage store = LibStorage.getBalanceStorage();
        BalanceStorage storage balanceStorage = store[account][currencyId];
        int256 cashBalance = balanceStorage.cashBalance;

        // Only return cash balances less than zero
        debtBalance = cashBalance < 0 ? debtBalance : 0;   //<------@audit wrong, Always return 0
    }
```

In the above code we can see that due to a spelling error,  `debtBalance` always ==0 
should use `debtBalance = cashBalance < 0 ? cashBalance : 0;`

## Impact

`getAccountPrimeDebtBalance()` is the external method to check the debt
  If a third party integrates with notional protocol, this method will be used to determine whether the user has debt or not and handle it accordingly, which may lead to serious errors in the third party's business

        int256 debtBalance
    ) {
        mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => BalanceStorage)) storage store = LibStorage.getBalanceStorage();
        BalanceStorage storage balanceStorage = store[account][currencyId];
        int256 cashBalance = balanceStorage.cashBalance;

        // Only return cash balances less than zero
-       debtBalance = cashBalance < 0 ? debtBalance : 0;
