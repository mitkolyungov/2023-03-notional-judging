# Users can deny the treasury manager contract from claiming `COMP` incentives

## Summary

Users can deny the treasury manager contract from claiming `COMP` incentives by front-running the `Comptroller.claimComp()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

The treasury manager is appointed by the Notional DAO and is tasked with harvesting rewards (e.g. `COMP` incentives). The `TreasuryManager.harvestCOMPFromNotional` function will call `TreasuryAction.claimCOMPAndTransfer` to claim the `COMP` incentives on behalf of Notional.

```solidity
File: TreasuryAction.sol
111:     function claimCOMPAndTransfer(address[] calldata cTokens)
112:         external
113:         override
114:         onlyManagerContract
115:         nonReentrant
116:         returns (uint256)
117:     {
118:         uint256 balanceBefore = COMP.balanceOf(address(this));
119:         COMPTROLLER.claimComp(address(this), cTokens);
120:         uint256 balanceAfter = COMP.balanceOf(address(this));
121: 
122:         // NOTE: the onlyManagerContract modifier prevents a transfer to address(0) here
123:         uint256 netBalance = balanceAfter.sub(balanceBefore);
124:         if (netBalance > 0) {
125:             COMP.safeTransfer(msg.sender, netBalance);
126:         }
127: 
128:         // NOTE: TreasuryManager contract will emit a COMPHarvested event
129:         return netBalance;
130:     }
```

The issue is that the `TreasuryAction.claimCOMPAndTransfer` function will take a snapshot of the `COMP` balance before claiming to avoid inadvertently transferring `COMP` from the Notional platform. However, the `Comptroller.claimComp()` function is callable by anyone. 

Therefore, if a malicious user frontruns a call to claim `COMP` incentives, the before/after snapshot will ultimately claim the zero amount. The code `uint256 netBalance = balanceAfter.sub(balanceBefore)` at Line 123 above will always produce zero if the call to `COMPTROLLER.claimComp` is front-run.

As a result, `COMP` incentives are forever lost in the contract as there is no function to sweep tokens.

## Impact

Loss of assets as the reward tokens intended for Notional and its users are lost.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider taking the difference against the `StoredTokenBalance` of the reward tokens instead of doing a before and after balance so that any additional tokens available in the contract that are not actively tracked by the `StoredTokenBalance` will be skimmed.
