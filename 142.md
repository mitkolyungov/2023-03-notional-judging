# Markets can be initialized before the quarter ends.

## Summary
before 90 days are up markets can be initialized
## Vulnerability Detail
in `initializeMarketsAction.sol` there is function called `initializeMarkets` which initializes markets for a given currency id. In the comments it says it should be initialized once every quarter which is 90 days. however there is no check that indeed 90 days have gone by since it was last initialized.
## Impact
markets could be initialized multiple times
