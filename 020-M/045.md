# Vault accounts cannot be liquidated before maturity

## Summary

Vault accounts cannot be liquidated before maturity

## Vulnerability Detail

- user can borrow from a vault according to his prime cash collateral
- he can borrow some more prime cash (leverage)
- now, vault account CAN go below the minimum collateral ratio, as the deleverageAccount function comment says

```solidity
/// @notice If an account is below the minimum collateral ratio, this method wil deleverage (liquidate)
/// that account.
function deleverageAccount(
```

- However, vault accounts cannot be settled before the maturity:

```solidity
function _authenticateDeleverage

	// Vault accounts that are not settled must be settled first by calling settleVaultAccount
	require(block.timestamp < vaultAccount.maturity, "Must Settle");
```

Now, in the `settleVaultAccount`

```solidity
/// @notice Settles a matured vault account by transforming it from an fCash maturity into
/// a prime cash account.
function settleVaultAccount(address account, address vault) external override nonReentrant {
```

and then `VaultAccountLib.settleVaultAccount`, is this check

```solidity
if (vaultAccount.maturity == 0 || block.timestamp < vaultAccount.maturity) return (false, false);
```

This means that vault cannot be settle before maturity.

Market intervals are seemingly set for 3 months. This means the interval until account can be deleveraged is considerable.  

## Impact

Protocol cannot deleverage insolvent accounts.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
// Vault accounts that are not settled must be settled first by calling settleVaultAccount
require(block.timestamp < vaultAccount.maturity, "Must Settle");
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Allow deleveraging of vault accounts that are undercollateralized.
