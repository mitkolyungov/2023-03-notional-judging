# giovannarevitoroz - Tautology

## Summary
A tautology in propositional logic is a formula that is true in all truth assignments and indicates possible logical flaws or redundant checks. for example. x >= 0 which is always true if x is uint.

The use of tatuology or contradiction directly in conditionals is unnecessary and the reason for this is that if there is a conditional whose predicate is true, it can be removed because that block of code would be executed anyway and in the same way if the predicate is the constant boolean false, so that could be removed as well and along with the code in that associated block because that code would never get executed because the condition will always be false. Therefore, these uses of tatuology or contradiction (Boolean constants) specifically within conditionals are indicative of faulty logic or assumptions or may be used redundantly when identifying such usage.

## Vulnerability Detail
Kindly review the summary section.

## Impact
The precense of tatuologies in smart contracts are unnecessary and indicates either flawed logic or a mistaken assumptions made by the developer.

## Tool used

VS Code for manual review.

## Recommendation
Fix the incorrect comparison by changing the value type or the comparison removing those constants and any code blocks associated with them so that it becomes simpler to maintain.
