# Gas inefficiency in SafeInt256 usage

## Summary

The AccountAction.sol contract makes use of SafeInt256 for mathematical operations, which can be gas-inefficient due to the additional checks involved. It may be worth considering alternative libraries or implementing the required checks within the contract itself.

## Vulnerability Detail

The use of SafeInt256 for mathematical operations in the AccountAction.sol contract introduces additional checks that can result in gas inefficiency. This could lead to higher gas costs for users.

## Impact

Higher gas costs can negatively affect the platform's adoption and overall user experience, as users may be less inclined to interact with the platform due to increased costs.

## Recommendation

It is recommended to explore alternative libraries or implement the necessary checks within the contract itself to improve gas efficiency. Optimizing the contract's gas usage can lead to a better user experience and more cost-effective operations.
