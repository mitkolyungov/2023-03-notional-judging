# Prime vaults do not consider secondary debt when assessing vault fees

## Summary

Prime vaults do not have a maturity and are therefore charged fees on a pro-rata basis. However, when prime fees are assessed, only primary debt is taken into consideration and hence vaults much make use of multiple currencies will charge vault accounts according to the composition of their debt. Furthermore, it's important to note that vault account liquidations allow for debt compositions to change depending on what currencies are liquidated.

## Vulnerability Detail

Vault fees are assessed in _two_ different ways:
 - Assessed based on the length of time funds are borrowed. This scales linearly based on the maturity date and is only applicable to non-prime vault positions.
 - Prime vaults calculate fees at a fixed yearly rate and accrue these fees in key parts of the codebase.

As the vault implementation has been modified to accommodate secondary borrow currencies, it doesn't seem fair that fee assessment would be applied to vault users differently. It's incorrect to assume that all users hold the same proportion of debt in each borrowed currency. 

Users can also self-liquidate their primary debt to zero and avoid paying vault fees altogether.

## Impact

Ability to avoid paying vault fees altogether, disincentivising the use of non-prime vaults over prime vaults as sophisticated users can game fee mechanics.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Total debt in all borrowed currencies needs to be taken into consideration when calling `VaultConfiguration.assessVaultFees()`. 

`VaultSecondaryBorrow.getSecondaryBorrowCollateralFactors()` can be queried to retrieve the vault account's total secondary debt denominated in the primary account debt which can then be converted into prime cash alongside `accountDebtUnderlying`.
