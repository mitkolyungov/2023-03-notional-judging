# BaseERC4626Proxy.sol is not EIP-4626 compliant

## Summary
BaseERC4626Proxy.sol is not EIP-4626 compliant
## Vulnerability Detail
All official EIP-4626 requirements can be found on it's [official page](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626#methods). Non-compliant functions are listed below along with the reason they are not compliant:

The following functions are non-compliant because they don't account for withdraw and deposit locking:
- maxDeposit()
- maxMint()
- maxWithdraw()
- maxRedeem()
All of the above functions should return 0 when their respective functions are disabled (i.e. [maxDeposit](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626#maxdeposit) should return 0 when deposits are disabled but it doesn't).
```solidity
    function maxDeposit(address /*receiver*/) public override view returns (uint256 maxAssets) {
        // Both nTokens and pCash tokens are limited by the max underlying supply
        (
            /* */,
            /* */,
            uint256 maxUnderlyingSupply,
            uint256 currentUnderlyingSupply
        ) = NOTIONAL.getPrimeFactors(currencyId, block.timestamp);

        if (maxUnderlyingSupply == 0) {
            return type(uint256).max;
        } else if (maxUnderlyingSupply <= currentUnderlyingSupply) {
            return 0;
        } else {
            // No overflow here
            return (maxUnderlyingSupply - currentUnderlyingSupply)
                .mul(10 ** nativeDecimals)
                .div(uint256(Constants.INTERNAL_TOKEN_PRECISION));
        }
    }
```

The following are also non-compliant because they don't account for deposit and withdrawal fees:
- previewRedeem()
- previewWithdraw()
- previewMint()
- previewDeposit() 
All the above functions should include deposit/withdrawal fees to let integrators be aware of such fees (i.e [previewDeposit](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626#previewdeposit) should include fees to enable integrators be aware of the existence of deposit fees but it doesn't)
```solidity
    function previewDeposit(uint256 assets) external override view returns (uint256 shares) {
        return convertToShares(assets);
    }
```

## Impact
Other protocols that integrate with Notional may wrongly assume that the functions are EIP-4626 compliant. Thus, it might cause integration problems in the future that can lead to wide range of issues for both parties.
