# Inaccurate settlement reserve accounting

## Summary

The off-chain accounting of fCash debt or prime cash in the settlement reserve will be inaccurate due to an error when handling the conversion between signed and unsigned integers.

## Vulnerability Detail

Events will be emitted to reconcile off-chain accounting for the edge condition when leveraged vaults lend at zero interest. This event will be emitted if there is fCash debt or prime cash in the settlement reserve.

In an event where `s.fCashDebtHeldInSettlementReserve > 0` and `s.primeCashHeldInSettlementReserve <= 0`, no event will be emitted. As a result, the off-chain accounting of fCash debt or prime cash in the settlement reserve will be off. 

The reason is that since `fCashDebtInReserve` is the negation of `s.fCashDebtHeldInSettlementReserve`, which is an unsigned integer, `fCashDebtInReserve` will always be less than or equal to 0. Therefore, `fCashDebtInReserve > 0` will always be false and is an unsatisfiable condition.

File: PrimeRateLib.sol
457:         // This is purely done to fully reconcile off chain accounting with the edge condition where
458:         // leveraged vaults lend at zero interest.
459:         int256 fCashDebtInReserve = -int256(s.fCashDebtHeldInSettlementReserve);
460:         int256 primeCashInReserve = int256(s.primeCashHeldInSettlementReserve);
461:         if (fCashDebtInReserve > 0 || primeCashInReserve > 0) {
462:             int256 settledPrimeCash = convertFromUnderlying(settlementRate, fCashDebtInReserve);
463:             int256 excessCash;
464:             if (primeCashInReserve > settledPrimeCash) {
465:                 excessCash = primeCashInReserve - settledPrimeCash;
466:                 BalanceHandler.incrementFeeToReserve(currencyId, excessCash);
467:             } 
468: 
469:             Emitter.emitSettlefCashDebtInReserve(
470:                 currencyId, maturity, fCashDebtInReserve, settledPrimeCash, excessCash
471:             );
472:         }
```

## Impact

The off-chain accounting of fCash debt or prime cash in the settlement reserve will be inaccurate. Users who rely on inaccurate accounting information to conduct any form of financial transaction will expose themselves to unintended financial risks and make ill-informed decisions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to implement the following fix:

```diff
- int256 fCashDebtInReserve = -int256(s.fCashDebtHeldInSettlementReserve);
+ int256 fCashDebtInReserve = int256(s.fCashDebtHeldInSettlementReserve);
```
