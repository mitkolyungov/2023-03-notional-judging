# Liquidation discount does not take slippage into consideration

## Summary

Multi-currency vaults will primarily be used to LP into various pools. Because there is some expected slippage when redeeming LP tokens, liquidators may lose out by purchasing an account's vault shares.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a liquidator purchases vault shares, the amount they receive is scaled up by some liquidation rate, allowing them to purchase vault shares and redeem these at a profit. However, this fails to include fees incurred via slippage when redeeming the LP tokens. As a result, the liquidator may actually receive less tokens than what they deposited, leading to an overall loss in the liquidation trade for them.

```solidity
File: VaultValuation.sol
209:     function getLiquidationFactors(
210:         VaultConfig memory vaultConfig,
211:         VaultAccountHealthFactors memory h,
212:         VaultSecondaryBorrow.SecondaryExchangeRates memory er,
213:         uint256 currencyIndex,
214:         int256 vaultShares,
215:         int256 depositUnderlyingInternal
216:     ) internal pure returns (int256, uint256) {
             ...
273:         int256 depositAmountPrimary = depositUnderlyingInternal.mul(er.rateDecimals).div(exchangeRate);
274:         uint256 vaultSharesToLiquidator = _calculateVaultSharesToLiquidator(
275:             vaultShares,
276:             vaultConfig.liquidationRate,
277:             h.vaultShareValueUnderlying,
278:             depositAmountPrimary
279:         );
280: 
281:         return (depositUnderlyingInternal, vaultSharesToLiquidator);
282:     }
```

Because share redemption is done outside of `deleverageAccount()`, it is not possible to accurately determine how much slippage to expect when redeeming LP tokens. Therefore, the vault implementation should define what this rate should be such that liquidators are still able to profit when deleveraging vault accounts.

```solidity

368:     function _calculateVaultSharesToLiquidator(
369:         int256 vaultShares,
370:         int256 liquidationRate,
371:         int256 vaultShareValueUnderlying,
372:         int256 liquidatorDepositPrimaryUnderlying
373:     ) private pure returns (uint256 vaultSharesToLiquidator) {
374:         // Calculates the following:
375:         //                liquidationRate * liquidatorDeposit
376:         // vaultShares * -----------------------------------
377:         //                RATE_PRECISION * vaultShareValue
378:         vaultSharesToLiquidator = vaultShares
379:             .mul(liquidationRate)
380:             .mul(liquidatorDepositPrimaryUnderlying)
381:             .div(vaultShareValueUnderlying)
382:             .div(Constants.RATE_PRECISION)
383:             .toUint();
384:     }
```

## Impact

Liquidators lack the incentive to purchase vault shares and therefore certain accounts may become insolvent.

## Recommendation

Consider incorporating slippage fees into the liquidation discount to ensure liquidators are always incentivised to purchase vault shares from unhealthy vault accounts. Alternatively, a fixed slippage discount can be applied to vault shares which is defined by the vault implementation.
