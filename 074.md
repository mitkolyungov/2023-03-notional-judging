# AccountAction#withdraw() might fail when one of the other money markets (Compound, Aave, or Euler) fails temporarily.

## Summary
``AccountAction#withdraw()`` might fail when one of the other money markets (Compound, Aave, or Euler) fails temporarily.  The main problem is that when there is not sufficient balance of underlying, the protocol will redeem from other money markets. However, if one redemption fails, the whole redemption process will fail, even though it is possible to redeem from the rest money markets to cover the withdrawal amount. 

The impact is bad customer experience or loss of funds due to failure of timely withdrawal. 

## Vulnerability Detail

``AccountAction#withdraw()`` allows a user to withdraw balances from Notional:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/external/actions/AccountAction.sol#L173-L210](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/external/actions/AccountAction.sol#L173-L210)

It will check if there is sufficient balance of the underlying to cover the withdrawl amount, and if not, it will redeem from other money markets (Compound, Aave, or Euler) to cover the deficit. While it attempts to redeem from multiple money markets, if one redemption fails, then the whole redemption process will fail, and thus the whole withdraw flow. This is not necessary, the function could have redeemed from the rest of the markets and still might be able to honor the withdrawl amount. 

To see this, consider the following flow: ``AccountAction#withdraw()->BalanceHandler#finalizeWithdraw()->_finalize()->TokenHandler#withdrawPrimeCash()->_redeemMoneyMarketIfRequired()->executeMoneyMarketRedemptions()``. 

Let's focus on the code for ``TokenHandler#executeMoneyMarketRedemptions()`` and in particular L375. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/balances/TokenHandler.sol#L357-L396](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/balances/TokenHandler.sol#L357-L396)

``executeMoneyMarketRedemptions()`` will revert when ONE redemption call reverts even though it is possible to redeem from the rest of the money markets. 

For example, suppose the Compound protocol fails temporarily today, but Aave and Euler are active and functioning, however,  ``executeMoneyMarketRedemptions()``` will still fail although it can safely redeem from Aave and Euler successfully. 

## Impact
``AccountAction#withdraw()`` might fail when one of the other money markets (Compound, Aave, or Euler) fails.  A more fault-tolerant NOTIONAL protocol should tolerate some temporary failures from some money markets.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a try/catch for each redemption call to external money market so that the redemption process is fault-tolerant.
