# Tokens that implements safeApprove are incompatible with setCTokenAddress in NotionalV2FlashLiquidator

## Summary
Tokens that implements safeApprove are incompatible with setCTokenAddress in NotionalV2FlashLiquidator

## Vulnerability Detail
On NotionalV2FlashLiquidator, the setCTokenAddress would call `checkAllowanceOrSet`; which call an approve function without first setting the apporved amount to 0. some stricter non-standard ERC20 token would not allow that.

```solidity
    function setCTokenAddress(address cToken) external onlyOwner {
        address underlying = _setCTokenAddress(cToken);
        // Lending pool needs to be able to pull underlying
        checkAllowanceOrSet(underlying, LENDING_POOL);
    }

```
