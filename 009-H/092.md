# ETH locked during migration

## Summary
Migration will lock all ether in the contract
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_initializePrimeCash` function does not handle eth balance retrieval correctly
```solidity
    function _initializePrimeCash(
        uint16 currencyId,
        Token memory assetToken,
        Token memory underlyingToken,
        MigrationSettings memory settings
    ) private {
        // Will set the initial token balance storage to whatever is on the contract at the time
        // of migration.
        PrimeCashExchangeRate.initTokenBalanceStorage(currencyId, settings.primeCashOracle);

        // Any dust underlying token balances will be donated to the prime supply and aggregated into
        // the underlying scalar value. There is currently some dust ETH balance on Notional that will
        // get donated to all prime cash holders.
        uint88 currentAssetTokenBalance = assetToken.convertToInternal(
            IERC20(assetToken.tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this)).toInt()
        ).toUint().toUint88();
```
As we can see in the snippet above, when the function goes to check balance of ETH inside the contract, it does so with
```solidity
IERC20(assetToken.tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this)
```
this will not work for native ETH. To correctly retrieve balance of ETH , the contract should call with
```solidity
 address(this).balance
```
because the function does not correctly retrieve the balance of ETH, all of the ETH will be stuck inside the contract inside migration.
## Impact
When migrating, all ETH will be locked inside the contract

## Recommendation
We recommend the function retrieves the balance of ether inside the contract using
```solidity
address(this).balance
```
