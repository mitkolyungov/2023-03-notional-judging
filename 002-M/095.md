# initialize function in Router.sol and Market.sol can be invoked multiple times from the implementation contract

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
initialize function in Router.sol and Market.sol 

can be invoked multiple times from the implementation contract.

this means a compromised implementation can reinitialize the contract above and

become the owner to complete the privilege escalation then drain the user's fund.

Usually in an Upgradeable contract, a initialize function is protected by the modifier

```solidity
 initializer
```

to make sure the contract can only be initialized once.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/external/Router.sol#L90

```solidity
function initialize(address owner_, address pauseRouter_, address pauseGuardian_) public {
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/markets/Market.sol#L189-L193

```solidity
    function setMarketStorageForInitialize(
        MarketParameters memory market,
        uint256 currencyId,
        uint256 settlementDate
    ) internal {
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend the project use the modifier

```solidity
 initializer
```

to protect the initialize function from being reinitiated
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/external/Router.sol#L90

```solidity
function initialize(address owner_, address pauseRouter_, address pauseGuardian_) public initializer {
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/markets/Market.sol#L189-L193

```solidity
    function setMarketStorageForInitialize(
        MarketParameters memory market,
        uint256 currencyId,
        uint256 settlementDate
    ) internal  initializer {
```
