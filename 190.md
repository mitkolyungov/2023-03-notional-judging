# Unable to transfer fee reserve assets to treasury

## Summary

Transferring fee reserve assets to the treasury manager contract will result in a revert, leading to a loss of rewards for NOTE stakers.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/external/actions/TreasuryAction.sol#L135

```solidity
File: TreasuryAction.sol
132:     /// @notice redeems and transfers tokens to the treasury manager contract
133:     function _redeemAndTransfer(uint16 currencyId, int256 primeCashRedeemAmount) private returns (uint256) {
134:         PrimeRate memory primeRate = PrimeRateLib.buildPrimeRateStateful(currencyId);
135:         int256 actualTransferExternal = TokenHandler.withdrawPrimeCash(
136:             treasuryManagerContract,
137:             currencyId,
138:             primeCashRedeemAmount.neg(),
139:             primeRate,
140:             true // if ETH, transfers it as WETH
141:         );
142: 
143:         require(actualTransferExternal > 0);
144:         return uint256(actualTransferExternal);
145:     }
```

The value returned by the [`TokenHandler.withdrawPrimeCash`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/balances/TokenHandler.sol#L220) function is always less than or equal to zero. Thus, the condition `actualTransferExternal > 0` will always be false, and the `_redeemAndTransfer` function will always revert.

The `transferReserveToTreasury` function depends on `_redeemAndTransfer` function. Thus, it is not possible to transfer any asset to the treasury manager contract.

## Impact

The fee collected by Notional is stored in the Fee Reserve. The fee reserve assets will be transferred to Notional's Treasury to be invested into the sNOTE pool. Without the ability to do so, the NOTE stakers will not receive their rewards.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Negate the value returned by the `TokenHandler.withdrawPrimeCash` function.

```diff
        int256 actualTransferExternal = TokenHandler.withdrawPrimeCash(
            treasuryManagerContract,
            currencyId,
            primeCashRedeemAmount.neg(),
            primeRate,
            true // if ETH, transfers it as WETH
-       );
+       ).neg();
```
