# User can lose nTokens when redeeming

## Summary

User can lose nTokens when redeeming

## Vulnerability Detail

When `nTokenRedeemAction::_redeem` is called, the `tokensToWithdraw` are calculated using the `getLiquidityTokenWithdraw` function.

```solidity
// Returns the liquidity tokens to withdraw per market and the netfCash amounts. Net fCash amounts are only
        // set when ifCashBits != 0. Otherwise they must be calculated in _withdrawLiquidityTokens
        (int256[] memory tokensToWithdraw, int256[] memory netfCash) = nTokenCalculations.getLiquidityTokenWithdraw(
            nToken, tokensToRedeem, block.timestamp, ifCashBits
        );
```

The `getLiquidityTokenWithdraw` calculates the `tokensToWithdraw` as follows

```solidity
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokensToWithdraw.length; i++) {
            int256 totalTokens = nToken.portfolioState.storedAssets[i].notional;
            // Redeemer's baseline share of the liquidity tokens based on total supply:
            //      redeemerShare = totalTokens * nTokensToRedeem / totalSupply
            // Scalar factor to account for residual value (need to inflate the tokens to withdraw
            // proportional to the value locked up in ifCash residuals):
            //      scaleFactor = totalPortfolioAssetValue / totalPrimeValueInMarkets
            // Final math equals:
            //      tokensToWithdraw = redeemerShare * scalarFactor
            //      tokensToWithdraw = (totalTokens * nTokensToRedeem * totalPortfolioAssetValue)
            //         / (totalPrimeValueInMarkets * totalSupply)
            tokensToWithdraw[i] = totalTokens
                .mul(nTokensToRedeem)
                .mul(totalPortfolioAssetValue);

            tokensToWithdraw[i] = tokensToWithdraw[i]
                .div(totalPrimeValueInMarkets)
                .div(nToken.totalSupply);

            // This is the share of net fcash that will be credited back to the account
            netfCash[i] = netfCash[i].mul(tokensToWithdraw[i]).div(totalTokens);
        }

        return (tokensToWithdraw, netfCash);
```

There is the possibility of `tokensToWithdraw` returned being 0 for small amounts of `nTokensToRedeem`. As there is no check to ensure `tokensToWithdraw` is greater than 0, the user would lose their nTokens without getting any tokens.

## Impact

Users would lose nTokens.

## Recommendation

Ensure that `tokensToWithdraw` is greater than 0 for positive values of `nTokensToRedeem`
