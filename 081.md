# getfCashBorrowFromPrincipal(uint16 currencyId, uint256 borrowedAmountExternal, uint256 maturity, uint32 maxBorrowRate, uint256 blockTime, bool useUnderlying)

## Summary
getfCashBorrowFromPrincipal(uint16 currencyId, uint256 borrowedAmountExternal, uint256 maturity, uint32 maxBorrowRate, uint256 blockTime, bool useUnderlying)

## Vulnerability Detail
The function uses the _convertDepositAmountToUnderlyingInternal function, which can lead to integer overflow.

## Impact
