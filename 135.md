# BaseERC4626Proxy is not compliant with ERC-4626 standard due to unexpected `revert`

## Summary
Zero vault shares (total supply) leads to non ERC-4626 compliance of vault due to unexpected `revert` and therefore bears DoS risk for higher level protocol methods.

## Vulnerability Detail
Since the [BaseERC4626Proxy](https://github.com/notional-finance/contracts-v2/blob/b20a45c912785fab5f2b62992e5260f44dbae197/contracts/external/proxies/BaseERC4626Proxy.sol) contract implements the [IERC4626](https://github.com/notional-finance/contracts-v2/blob/b20a45c912785fab5f2b62992e5260f44dbae197/interfaces/IERC4626.sol) interface, which contains the [ERC-4626: Tokenized Vaults](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) specification in its comments, it is safe to assume that the [BaseERC4626Proxy](https://github.com/notional-finance/contracts-v2/blob/b20a45c912785fab5f2b62992e5260f44dbae197/contracts/external/proxies/BaseERC4626Proxy.sol) contract should be compliant with the [ERC-4626: Tokenized Vaults](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626)  standard.  

According to the ERC-4626 standard, the external methods `convertToShares()` and `convertToAssets()` **must not revert** unless due to integer overflow caused by an unreasonably large input. However, both of these methods rely on the public method [exchangeRate()](https://github.com/notional-finance/contracts-v2/blob/b20a45c912785fab5f2b62992e5260f44dbae197/contracts/external/proxies/BaseERC4626Proxy.sol#L303-L309) which **does revert** in case of `_totalSupply()` (`totalSupply()`: the number of shares issued by the vault) returning `0`.  Therefore the vault is not compliant with the standard.  
In contrast to an ERC-20 token which usually mints a non-zero amount of tokens at construction, having zero shares, i.e no underlying assets deposited, is a vaild state wthin the life-cycle of an ERC-4626 vault.  
Furthermore, `BaseERC4626Proxy` is an abstract contract and the internal method `_totalSupply()` needs to be implemented by derived contracts. Consquently, one cannot rely on `_totalSupply()` always returnung a non-zero value.

## Impact
In addition to the `BaseERC4626Proxy` contract not being ERC-4626 compliant, the external methods `maxMint()`, `previewDeposit()`, `previewWithdraw()`, `maxWithdraw()`, `previewMint()`, `previewRedeem()`, `withdraw()` and `mint()` directly or indirectly call `convertToShares()` and `convertToAssets()`. Therefore, these methods also revert in a non standard compliant way in case of zero vault shares.  
This might lead to DoS for users of the vault, i.e. the Notional V3 protocol, during the life-cycle of the vault.  

## Code Snippet
From [BaseERC4626Proxy.sol](https://github.com/notional-finance/contracts-v2/blob/b20a45c912785fab5f2b62992e5260f44dbae197/contracts/external/proxies/BaseERC4626Proxy.sol#L303-L309):
```solidity
    function exchangeRate() public view returns (uint256 rate) {
        uint256 totalValueExternal = _getTotalValueExternal();
        uint256 supply = _totalSupply(); // @audit Can be 0
        // Exchange Rate from token to Underlying in EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION is:
        // 1 token = totalValueExternal * EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION / totalSupply
        rate = totalValueExternal.mul(EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION).div(supply); // @audit SafeUint256 reverts on .div(0)
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend to catch the case of `_totalSupply()` returning `0` according to the following snippet:
```solidity
    function exchangeRate() public view returns (uint256 rate) {
        uint256 totalValueExternal = _getTotalValueExternal();
        uint256 supply = _totalSupply(); // @audit Can be 0
        // Exchange Rate from token to Underlying in EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION is:
        // 1 token = totalValueExternal * EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION / totalSupply
        if (supply > 0) {
            rate = totalValueExternal.mul(EXCHANGE_RATE_PRECISION).div(supply);
        }
        else {
            return <non-zero value>;  // TODO: exchange rate in case of 0 shares
        }
    }
```
