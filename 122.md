# Compound exchange rate can be manipulated to withdraw more underlying tokens from NotionalV3

## Summary
Prime cash underlying values can be manipulated via donating the underlying to cToken contract to inflate the cToken price and then withdrawing from Notional for more.
## Vulnerability Detail
Prime supply underlying value is calculated via few formulas and math operations let's check them:

To calculate the underlying interest rate:
(currentUnderlyingValue - lastUnderlyingValue) / lastUnderlyingValue
which we can say that underlying value can be in forms of DAI or cDAI (since the other protocol handlers are not in the audit scope I'll treat it as there is only CompoundV2 available for prime cash external lenders)
We can derive this formula for more context:
(((exchangeRate * totalCDAIHoldings) + totalDAIHolds) - ((previousExchangeRate * totalCDAIHoldings) + totalDAIHolds)) / ((previousExchangeRate * totalCDAIHoldings) + totalDAIHolds) = underlyingInterestRate

To calculate the underlying scalar:
lastScalar * (1 + underlyingInterestRate) = underlyingScalar

To calculate the supply factor:
supplyScalar * underlyingScalar = supplyFactor

To calculate the underlying final:
primeCashValue * supplyFactor = underlyingFinal

now considering these, if someone can manipulate the currentUnderlying (total underlying tokens that Notional holds) up to some level that they can make the prime cash value higher, than there will be a profit. Currently, NotionalV3 deposits the funds to CompoundV2 which the exchange rate is calculated as follows:

(totalCash + totalBorrows - totalReserves) / totalCDAISupply

where as totalCash is the balanceOf(token) in the cToken contract. This means that the donations can manipulate the exchange rate and make Notional V3 underlying oracle trick that the tokens worths more. That means the exchange rate can be calculated as this:

(airDropAmount + totalCash + totalBorrows - totalReserves) / totalCDAISupply

if we can find a scenario where underlyingFinal > airDropAmount + initialPrimeCash, someone can do a flash loan attack


Let's draw a scenario where this can happen ,
Assume cDAI has very low liquidity because Compound incentives the v3 usage, Notional is withdrawing its CompoundV2 positions slowly to DAI and getting ready to deploy them to CompoundV3. For this scenario case assume there are total of 100K cDAI which all of them hold by Notional (this can change, just for simplicity I am keeping it), now if attacker donates 50K DAI to cDAI attacker will make the new exchange rate 1.5. Here we go:

1- There are 220K DAI idle and 100K cDAI in Notional (for easiness let's assume 1cDAI == 1DAI)
2- Alice flashloans 4.83M DAI and deposits to Notional receiving 4.83M pDAI (we assume supplyFactor is 1, which is possible if we are early stages after migration, no interest accrued). Alice will make the total idle DAI balance in Notional as 5M after her deposit
3- Alice deposits the 50K DAI to cDAI contract to make the exchange rate 1.5 (100KDAI/100KCDAI was the initial state of cDAI, now 150K DAI / 100K CDAI = 1.5) 
4- Alice withdraws the 4.83M pDAI for 5M DAI

Let's prove the math,
lastUnderlying = (100K cDAI * 1 + 5M) = 5.1M

currentUnderlying = (100K cDAI * 1.5 + 5M) = 5.150M

underlyingInterestRate = (5.15M - 5.1M) / 5.1M = 0.045

underlyingScalar = 1 * (0.045+ 1) = 1.045

supplyScalar = 1 * 1.045 = 1.045

Result:
Alice deposited 4.78M DAI which she got 4.78M pDAI for it, now 4.78M pDAI worths 4.78M * 1.045 =  5M DAI (approx) 

Alice flashloaned 4.78M + 50K = 4.83M total flash loaned amount

5M - 4.83M = 170K DAI profit after her attack

In the end, Alice stole the 220K idle balance.


## Impact
Although the above example considers the compound cDAI has very low liquidity, the same scenario could happen with big numbers but that would require Notional to hold lots of liquidity. Since compound is literally incentivizing the compoundv3 over compoundv2 I assumed that scenario is not far away from reality. We also assumed supplyScalar was 1, which is possible since the prime market will start as 1 but also it doesn't really matter since we multiply with lastScalar and supplyScalar on both sides of equation, again it was 1 for simplicity.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Acknowledge that CompoundV2 exchange rate is exploitable via donating, if the CompoundV2 cTokens has low liquidity, donate attacks will be quite cheap which can cause pDAI manipulations aswell. If the CompoundV2 cToken liquidity goes below some level abort the CompoundV2 strategy and migrate to other money markets where liquidity is decent and exchange rate is not manipulatable.
