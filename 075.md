# _getSettleAmountArray should return a SettleAmount array instead of just one element in the array.

## Summary
``_getSettleAmountArray`` should return a SettleAmount array instead of just one element in the array.  This is inconsistent with the NatSpec of the function.

## Vulnerability Detail
``_getSettleAmountArray()`` is expected to return a SettleAmount array for the assets that will be settled:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/settlement/SettlePortfolioAssets.sol#L22-L44](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/settlement/SettlePortfolioAssets.sol#L22-L44)

However, instead of returning all the assets that need to be settled in an array, it only returns only one such asset as an element: 

```javascript
 SettleAmount[] memory settleAmounts = new SettleAmount[](currenciesSettled);
        if (currenciesSettled > 0) {
            settleAmounts[0].currencyId = lastCurrencyId;
            settleAmounts[0].presentPrimeRate = PrimeRateLib.buildPrimeRateStateful(lastCurrencyId);
        }

        return settleAmounts;
```


## Impact
Since only one asset is returned to be settled, the remaining assets, even though might have matured, will not be settled immediately, so their settlements will be delayed unnecessarily.

## Recommendation
Return all assets that need to be settled in an array. 

```diff
   function _getSettleAmountArray(
        PortfolioState memory portfolioState,
        uint256 blockTime
    ) private returns (SettleAmount[] memory) {
        uint256 currenciesSettled;
        uint16 lastCurrencyId = 0;
        if (portfolioState.storedAssets.length == 0) return new SettleAmount[](0);

+         SettleAmount[] memory settleAmounts = new SettleAmount[](portfolioState.storedAssets.length);

        // Loop backwards so "lastCurrencyId" will be set to the first currency in the portfolio
        // NOTE: if this contract is ever upgraded to Solidity 0.8+ then this i-- will underflow and cause
        // a revert, must wrap in an unchecked.
        for (uint256 i = portfolioState.storedAssets.length; (i--) > 0;) {
            PortfolioAsset memory asset = portfolioState.storedAssets[i];
            // Assets settle on exactly blockTime
            if (asset.getSettlementDate() > blockTime) continue;

            // Assume that this is sorted by cash group and maturity, currencyId = 0 is unused so this
            // will work for the first asset
            if (lastCurrencyId != asset.currencyId) {
                lastCurrencyId = asset.currencyId;
+  settleAmounts[currenciesSettled].currencyId = lastCurrencyId;
+            settleAmounts[currenciesSettled].presentPrimeRate = PrimeRateLib.buildPrimeRateStateful(lastCurrencyId);

                currenciesSettled++;
            }
        }

        // Actual currency ids will be set as we loop through the portfolio and settle assets
-        SettleAmount[] memory settleAmounts = new SettleAmount[](currenciesSettled);
-        if (currenciesSettled > 0) {
-            settleAmounts[0].currencyId = lastCurrencyId;
-            settleAmounts[0].presentPrimeRate = PrimeRateLib.buildPrimeRateStateful(lastCurrencyId);
-        }

+assembly{
+         mstore(settleAmounts, currenciesSettled)  // audit: adjust the length of the array
+ }

        return settleAmounts;
    }
```
