# unchecked return value of transfer()

## Summary
The return value of a transfer wasn't checked in withdraw() function found in NotionalV2FlashLiquidator.sol. 

## Vulnerability Detail
users that want to withdraw their tokens will lose their tokens in a situation where the transfer fails for unseen reasons. As the transfer tx won't be able to revert.
```solidity
  IERC20(token).transfer(owner, amount);
```
## Impact
users can lose their token due to unchecked return value of transfer()

## Recommendation
pls check the return value of transfers by putting the transfer in a require statement.

That will ensure the transfer reverts on failure.
