# Frontrunning risk for nToken and pCash allowance changes

## Summary
An approved spender can frontrun an allowance change to spend the previous allowance and then has the ability to spend the new allowance also.

## Vulnerability Detail
The nTokenAction contract implementing nToken and pCash ERC20 tokens doesn't offer any protection against “Multiple Withdrawal Attack” upon changing a spender's allowance via the ERC20 `approve()` function and the custom `nTokenTransferApproveAll()` function. 

This attack ([described in detail here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/)) requires an approved spender to detect and frontrun a transaction that calls `approve()` to modify their approval level to any non-zero amount.

## Impact
User funds can be taken in excess of intended allowance when approval level is being changed.

## Code Snippet
Relevant functions in the nTokenAction.sol implementation contract:

- [`nTokenTransferApprove()`](https://github.com/notional-finance/contracts-v2/blob/b20a45c912785fab5f2b62992e5260f44dbae197/contracts/external/actions/nTokenAction.sol#L103) proxied through `nTokenERC20Proxy._approve()`
- [`pCashTransferApprove()`](https://github.com/notional-finance/contracts-v2/blob/b20a45c912785fab5f2b62992e5260f44dbae197/contracts/external/actions/nTokenAction.sol#L117) proxied through `PrimeCashProxy._approve()`
- [`nTokenTransferApproveAll()`](https://github.com/notional-finance/contracts-v2/blob/b20a45c912785fab5f2b62992e5260f44dbae197/contracts/external/actions/nTokenAction.sol#L230)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add [increaseAllowance()` and `decreaseAllowance()](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#ERC20-increaseAllowance-address-uint256-) functions like OpenZeppelin's ERC20 implementation, use them in any Notional code that modifies nToken or pCash approval level, and update documentation to recommend external code to use them.
