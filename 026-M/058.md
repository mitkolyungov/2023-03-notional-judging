# getNetCashGroupValue() might return the wrong updated portfolio index where the function has ended.

## Summary
``getNetCashGroupValue()`` might return the wrong updated portfolio index where the function has ended when ``a.assetType != Constants.FCASH_ASSET_TYPE`` and ``a.currencyId != cashGroup.currencyId`` are both true. 

## Vulnerability Detail
``getNetCashGroupValue()`` returns the present value of all assets in the cash group as prime cash and the updated portfolio index where the function has ended.

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/valuation/AssetHandler.sol#L134-L169](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-notional/blob/main/contracts-v2/contracts/internal/valuation/AssetHandler.sol#L134-L169)

It iterates through each asset ``a`` in ``assets`` to add the new amount of ``presentValueUnderlying``.  The function will break from the for-loop when ``a.currencyId != cashGroup.currencyId``:

```javascript
if (a.currencyId != cashGroup.currencyId) break;
```
so that the correct ``j`` value, which is the updated portfolio index where the function has ended can be returned. 

Unfortunately, the following statement preceding the above statement might make the function return the wrong index. 

```javascript
if (a.assetType != Constants.FCASH_ASSET_TYPE) continue;
```

The main problem is that, when ``a.assetType != Constants.FCASH_ASSET_TYPE`` and ``a.currencyId != cashGroup.currencyId`` are both true., instead of breaking from the for-loop, the function will continue to the next iteration due to the order of these two statements, as a result, the value of ``j`` will be advanced by 1 and the the wrong ``j`` will be returned. 

For example, suppose when j=2, we have ``a.assetType != Constants.FCASH_ASSET_TYPE`` and ``a.currencyId != cashGroup.currencyId`` are both true, instead of returning ``j=2`` as the index, the function will continue for the next iteration, and then return an index > 2. 

## Impact
``getNetCashGroupValue()`` might return the wrong updated portfolio index where the function has ended when ``a.assetType != Constants.FCASH_ASSET_TYPE`` and ``a.currencyId != cashGroup.currencyId`` are both true.

## Recommendation
Change the order of these two statements, then the correct ``j``` will be returned.
