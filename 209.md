# Vault account liquidation does not charge a fee

## Summary

Notional does not impose a protocol fee on vault account liquidation, which in turn incentivizes users to take on risky vault positions and self-liquidate where necessary.

## Vulnerability Detail

Notional does not impose a protocol fee on vault account liquidation. When liquidating a vault account, the vault shares of the liquidated account are sold to the liquidator at a discount. At the end of the liquidation, the liquidated account will receive cash from the liquidator, and the liquidator will receive vault shares in return. As such, the vault account liquidation process is a zero-sum between the liquidator and the liquidatee.

It's also important to note that vault accounts can freely restructure their debt holdings denominate their debt in whatever currency they choose to.

## Impact

Users are incentivized to take on risky vault positions and self-liquidate where necessary. This sets a bad precedent for the protocol as it does not encourage users to manage healthy vault positions as they can simply self-liquidate and re-coup their vault shares and prime cash.

In the event of a major market downturn, a higher number of these risky vault positions might become insolvent, potentially leading to a larger amount of bad debt for the protocol to manage.

## Tool used

## Recommendation

Consider introducing a protocol fee on vault account liquidation to disincentivize self-liquidation. For instance, this could be a percentage of the total value being liquidated and the fee collected could be distributed to the protocol's treasury.
